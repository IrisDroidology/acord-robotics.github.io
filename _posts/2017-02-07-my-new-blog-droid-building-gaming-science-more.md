<h1 style="text-align: center;">The New Blog</h1>
<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier;">Hey everyone, I'm back with a new blog for the Alliance of Droids. This is going to be a new blog that I am running, which has all of my hobby information as well as a cool daily blog and artwork. </span>

<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier;">I will be trying to release daily blog posts, but expect at least 3 a week unless I say otherwise. You can check out my Twitter feed for information on when or IF I will be blogging that day. You can go to my twitter profile here: https://twitter.com/Droidology_AoD.</span>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">MICROBES IN MARS</h1>
<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">Microbes are small organisms that typically consist of one cell. Microbes are one of the organisms that most astrobiologists think could live on MarsÂ <strong>to this day</strong>. Single-celled organisms typically do not have as many requirements that we as humans do. Can you imagine living underground, hundreds of meters below the surface, with nothing to eat except the acidic waste coming from hydrothermal vents on the sea bed. You couldn't - the temperature would be far too hot, for one. And you'd drown. But single-celled organisms typically are more durable, more hardy, and can live in those environments.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">This brings us to the topic of extremophiles ON Mars. You should probably know what Mars is by now, but for those that don't, here is some quick facts:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">It is the fourth planet from the Sun, one planetary stop after us</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">It is ~4.6 billion years old, like most of the heavenly bodies in the solar system</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">It may have once been able to support life</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">There IS liquid water on the SURFACE</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">It is half the size of Earth</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">It has a VERY thin atmosphere which consists of mainly carbon dioxide</span></li>
 	<li>It has a huge ring of volcanoes dotted around the center of the planet</li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">It also has the largest mountain/volcano in the whole SOLAR SYSTEM, Olympus Mons.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">Olympus Mons is 27 kilometers high!</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">It has two polar ice caps like the Earth does</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">There have been many missions aimed at traveling to Mars, but very few actually succeed due to the so-called "Curse of Mars."</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">One of the most famous space probe failures is Beagle, a European Space Agency (ESA) mission aimed at discovering life on Mars.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">The very thin atmosphere may make Mars sound like a horrible place to live, especially considering that it is mainly made of CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), but there is more to it than just that - let's look!</span>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Where there is water, there is life</h2>
<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">Pick up a glass of water, any glass of water. Be it the glass that your little sister spat into when she was cleaning her teeth, or the glass that you yourself use every day with breakfast. It doesn't really matter, as long as it has water in it. Peer into the glass (or cup), and tell me what you see.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">Yes, that's right, you see a clear liquid. But inside this liquid is the stuff that we want to study! There are many chemicals that create the building blocks of life (such asÂ <em>amino acids</em>) inside your glass of water. But there are also microbes - unless you went into a clean room (at NASA), there will always be some microbes in your glass of water (aÂ <em>Clean Room</em> is a sterile room that astronauts and other man-made space objects go into to become completely sterile, so that microbes don't travel into space - otherwise, how could you tell if the microbes you find on the moon aren't just from the suit you were wearing that wasn't sterilized?).</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">Think about that fact for a second. Check out the blog tomorrow to see where this is headed!</span>
