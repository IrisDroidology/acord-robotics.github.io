<p>Hi there, I’m Nicholas. Just making a post to introduce myself and talk about my time with the Alliance of Droids.</p><p>As far as introductions go, there isn’t a lot to say. My name is Nicholas, I’m currently 17 years old, and I’m a geek. You can find me on most social media as Nickoyoshi.</p><p>2 years ago today, myself and my cousin Liam were talking about Star Wars and the different kinds of Droids and then we pretended that we made a new kind of Droid. We made a few more and eventually called them the Alliance of Droids. We then thought that we could make this an actual thing. We could make this a charity. We can make Droids to help those with disabilities. And so the Alliance of Droids was born. </p><p>My goals for the Alliance are to help those who can’t help themselves, or those who need extra/special help. To make all sorts of Droids for a variety of mental disabilities. Those are pretty much the goals of the Alliance. The ones I personally have for the Alliance don’t really differ that much. </p><p>My goals in life are to meet all kinds of people all over the world, learn what I can about anything really, and to create content.</p><p>That’s about it. Thanks for reading!</p><p>~ Nicholas</p>
