<p style="text-align: justify;">I have mentioned departments before on this site. I want to explain how they work and what you can do in them. There are a lot of departments to choose from, and if you have an idea for a new one submit an application form that I will release tomorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The requirements for becoming a specialist, or elder, is having played a major part in that department. Here is what you have to do to become a specialist for each department:</p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Droid Department - Build a Droid</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Gay Pride Department - Go on a protest and/or make some sort of petition/other</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Science Department - Write a scientific journal article of your choice and share your knowledge with us</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Gaming Department - Help code a game, or become a correspondent of the gaming Â magazine</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Yearbook &amp; History Department - Participate in a year book focusing on an item/operation/day of your choice</li>
</ul>
There are also members that can become so-called major leaders. These are single-person ranks that include:
<ul>
 	<li>Treasurer</li>
 	<li>Member Manager</li>
 	<li>Transport Manager</li>
 	<li>Leader of Department</li>
</ul>
You can check outÂ <a href="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/mp1/" target="_blank">this post</a>Â to see the badges, pins &amp; gemstones you get as a specialist/member/leader.

Basically these are the main departments, but if you have an idea for a new one let us know! We will have to appoint a member of the DROIDS COUNCIL as leader first so that we can co-ordinate when it first starts up.
