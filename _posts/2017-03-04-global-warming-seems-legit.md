<p style="text-align: justify;">Global warming - does it seem legitimate to you? Does it seem like a myth? Well, global warming is real. And completely terrifying. In today's post I will be talking all about my thoughts on global warming.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">What is Global Warming?</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Global Warming is a gradual increase in temperature that is mainly caused by humans. It is generally attributed to the so-called greenhouse gases - Carbon Dioxide &amp; Methane (CO2 &amp; CH4 are the most commonly known greenhouse gases) warming up the temperature of not just the ocean, but also the air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may know how a greenhouse works. If you don't, then here is a quick overview, step-by-step.</p>

<ol>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">The greenhouse is built out of glass, which lets the sun in and the plants absorb the heat</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Visible light is then converted to energy and heat</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Thus, this is how a greenhouse works!</li>
</ol>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Dangers of Global Warming</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, one of the main dangers with global warming is that the polar bears would die, and where would we get such entertainment watching them ROFL? Wait...I just remembered - we have iPhones to entertain us now!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But seriously, the polar bears could go extinct, as could the penguins! And all the coral in the world could die, not to mention the fact that the temperatures would become so warm that the polar ice caps would melt, creating more water and forcing us inland. In Australia, most capital cities are on the coast...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So Global Warming seems legitimate, and there is something we can do about it. So let's all pitch in to help save the Earth.</p>
