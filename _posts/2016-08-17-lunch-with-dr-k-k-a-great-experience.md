<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">My experience with Dr K. - 2014</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">I first met Dr Karl on the radio when I was in my graduation year. He does a weekly segment on TRIPLE J RADIO that allows you to ask him questions about science. I talked to him about 3 times on the radio in that year, and he was great to talk to and answered my questions in great detail.</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Meeting Dr K. - Book Launch (S.B&amp;S) - 2015</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Last year I met him at his book launch when he was talking about his book, Short Back &amp; Science. I got both of my books autographed by him - S.B&amp;S &amp; House of Karls. I also had a selfie with him and attended a great presentation.</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Lunch With Dr. K. - A great experience!</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">After entering the competition to win lunch with Karl, I won! I was able to go to an excellent presentation and learnt a lot. I got my photo of Sp-D2 (my first droid) autographed by him and also got to have another selfie with him. Thanks Dr. K!</span></p>
