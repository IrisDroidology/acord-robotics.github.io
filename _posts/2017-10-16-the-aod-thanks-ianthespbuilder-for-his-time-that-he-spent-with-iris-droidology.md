Ian Arbuckle (@IanTheSpBuilder) is my uncle and is a very good friend of mine. Despite being decades older than me, we have lots of fun together (goofy fun, sports fun, and fun doing things with the AoD).

Today I kissed Ian goodbye after he drove me (in Dad's Datsun 260z) to the train station. I won't see him again until next year.

Going back to school was slightly hard after being with him for a few days, but I want to make sure that I do what he would want me to do and behave the way he would want me to behave.

This morning, we completed the <a href="http://giftregistery.com">name a star giftbox</a>Â together. Go to my droid builder profile to see the certificate (which could take a month to get to me :)).

Thanks for reading.
