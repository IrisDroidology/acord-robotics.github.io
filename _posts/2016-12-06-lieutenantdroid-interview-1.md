Let's get straight into the interview, shall we?
<ul>
 	<li>Favourite colour?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>My favourite colour is gold, because it is both valuable but soft, like all humans. All humans are like this, and it represents this to me.

<ul>
 	<li>Dream car?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Some sort of Subaru, maybe the new WRX, maybe gold, silver or dark blue, with a custom number plate saying LDroid and a smooth interior.

@liamaod</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>Favourite band/singer?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Defo Owl City (Adam Young). Owl City was born from Adam's sleeping disorder, like how the AoD was born from my disability, and all his songs - even the love songs - mean something to me. My favourite Owl city song was This isn't the end, which told the story of a dad who commited suicide.

I also really love David Bowie, especially Valentine's Day (2013), and Starman (1972?)

<ul>
 	<li>Favourite movie series?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Star Wars, of course!
