<h1 style="text-align: center;">Last Time...</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last time on Liam's Blog we talked about Astrobiology, which is one of my specialist subjects. We briefly touched on what it was, but that was about it.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">KEY PIONEERS IN ASTROBIOLOGY</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Astrobiology is a relatively new science but there have been scientists in history that have contributed to this field.Â Giordano Bruno, an Italian philosopher, was burned at the stake in 1600 (exactly 417 years ago) for his "heretical" views on life in the universe. He was prosecuted partly for this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In space there are countless constellations, suns and planets; we see only the suns because they give light; the planets remain invisible, for they are small and dark. There are also numberless earths circling around their suns</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another key pioneer in the science of Astrobiology is Charles Cockell. He is a professor of Astrobiology at <a href="https://coursera.org" target="_blank">Coursera Online University</a>Â (where I studied astrobiology).</p>
