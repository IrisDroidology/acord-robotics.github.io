Firstly, let me just say that I am sorry for not having posted for a little while. I have been quite busy with coding and also updating the pages on the site and as such have not been able to do daily blog posts. But hopefully I am free to do blog posts (mostly) every day for a while.

The Great Barrier Reef is not only Australia's most popular tourism destination, it is also an endangered world heritage site (<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-03/how-healthy-is-the-great-barrier-reef-fact-file/5649810">ABC.net.au</a>). It is a coral reef system, the largest in the world. Unfortunately for the tourism industry, it is also dying. The main reasons are:
<ol>
 	<li>Coral Bleaching (See Part 1)</li>
 	<li>Crown of Thorns Starfish (See Part 2)</li>
 	<li>Pollution (See Part 3)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As always, please follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Droidology_AoD">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://fb.me/DroidsAllianceBlog">Facebook</a> &amp; <a href="https://droidology.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>Â to get the latest updates on the blog!</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">CORAL BLEACHING</h1>
Coral Bleaching is a stress response of coral. The most common way that coral gets bleached is from the warming sea temperatures, which I will talk about in my next post, Global Warming - Seems Legit! - A look from an astrobiologist's point of view.

Basically the steps are:
<ol>
 	<li>The sea temperature warms up (<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">FUN FACT:Â </span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">if the temperature increases by more than 2 degrees Celsius outside the coral's temperature range, it WILL DIE).</span></li>
 	<li>The coral expels the algae inside their tissue, and so...</li>
 	<li>Turn white</li>
 	<li>A sad end for a magnificent reef</li>
</ol>
Coral Bleaching can also be caused by tropical cyclones, which cause ocean acidification.

<hr />

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Crown of Thorns Starfish</h1>
The Crown of Thorns Starfish is a multi-armed, large starfish that mainly preys on the hard/stony coral polyps, including the ones in the Great Barrier Reef. It is one of the largest Starfish species in the world and gets its name from the long, venomous spines that cover its upper surface (I'm sorry, can't put it into better words that Wikipedia's. LMAO).
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FACT FILE:</span></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Scientific Name: <em>A</em><i>canthaster planci (</i>mine isÂ <em>Astrobiologistis droidologitis)</em></li>
 	<li>Favourite Food: Stony Coral Polyps (mine is <a href="http://nandos.com.au">Nando's!</a>)</li>
 	<li>Location: Mainly in Eastern Australia, also seen (rarely) near the west coast of Africa - Indo-Pacific Region</li>
 	<li>Fun Fact No. 1: On healthy coral reefs, it can actually be good - tends to feed on the faster-growing corals, leaving the slower-growing corals time to build a colony</li>
 	<li>Not-so-fun-fact No. 1: Coral cover on surveyed AUSTRALIAN reefs has declined by 50% over the past 30 years, <em>A</em><i>canthaster planci</i> responsible for almost half of this decline</li>
 	<li>Not-so-fun-fact No. 2: Outbreaks occur every 17 years (last one occured 2010, first DOCUMENTED one in the 1960's)</li>
 	<li>Fun Fact No. 2: They spawn during the warmer months</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h1 style="text-align: center;">POLLUTION</h1>
And now, we get to the final part of the Great Barrier Reef's troubles - pollution. Pollution is the thing that you see pumping out of giant pipes, the things that you flush down the toilet that I would rather not mention. This stuff can go down through the pipes, out into the ocean - where the Great Barrier Reef is!

What is more, this can cause the reef to die and also the se turtles that live there!
