<h2>PREAMBLE</h2>
We, the members of the Board of the Alliance of Droids, now found the official constitution for the government of our association.

Formed on the 23rd of December, the Alliance of Droids has not exactly lived a lawless life. However, all good businesses have a constitution nowadays, and we want to jump on the bandwagon. In this document, the AoD will outline every rule and law that will govern our society. Every 6 months, we will hold meetings that will introduce new laws, change rules or even remove some altogether.

We are a community of droidlings and we want to stand proud.

Signed: <a href="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/droidlings/droidologyiris"><em>Limo Arbuckle, CEO, AoD</em></a>

<h1>Chapter 1 – Purpose</h1>
The original purpose for the Alliance of Droids was to create items for members of the disabled community like the MAKE A WISH <a title="Starlight" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starlight/">#Starlight</a> foundation, however we have since branched out into creating “droids” of many different shapes and forms. For example, we have story writing droids (books, poems and novels (and more) written by our Droidlings), companion droids (to reduce suicide risks, and help people – young droidlings – with disabilities), and so much more.
<h2>Part 1 – Types of Droids</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Story writing droids</li>
 	<li>Companion Droids</li>
 	<li>Game Droids (games as well as gaming robots)</li>
 	<li>Science Droids (experiments)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 2 – How to log your Droids</h2>
There are many different ways to log your droids. First, log in to your group and create a new document. Title it with your USERNAME, DROID NAME, &amp; YEAR. Then add all the files that you have to do with it and add the build log. Then hit “SAVE.”

Also, upload all your documents to the DOCUMENTS section. You can also message a moderator of the group to include your doc in the DROIDFOLIO section of the group menu.

Once you have received 200 points (upload images to the media gallery, update your status, logs, documents, etc.), you become a specialist of your department and can receive a special gemstone for your droid box.

<h1>Chapter 2 – Members</h1>
From here on in (since the 23rd of December 2015), we will be known as the Alliance of Droids, short name being the Droids, the AoD, or the Alliance.
<h2>Part 1 – Signing up</h2>
Members can request an audience with a member by signing up with our Google+ form OR by meeting a member in person. Members must go through the selection phase before being added manually through the backend by a member of the Board:
<ul>
 	<li>Limo (CEO)</li>
 	<li>Nick (Chairman)</li>
 	<li>Ian (Board)</li>
 	<li>Oscar (Board)</li>
</ul>
From now, the selection process has become:
<h3>Selection Process for Members</h3>
Due to bullies, spam bots and insignificant rebels, we, the board of the Alliance, have decided to instead have a selection process. During this selection process, we will decide whether the candidate is who they say they are, and is worthy to <a title="DonTheDroids" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DonTheDroids/">#DonTheDroids</a> and become a vital role in our phase as a charity.

This process can be completed in any order.

Here are the requirements:
<ul>
 	<li>Video chat/irl chat/reference that you are who you say you are</li>
 	<li>Why do you want to join the AoD?</li>
 	<li>Complete a resume (new members after 2017 only) – at least half a page with what you want to do in the AoD, complete with a picture (we can search for it on google images, and if that comes up with a different name then we will know that they are lying)</li>
 	<li>Narrow down the resumes (only if we have more than 5 coming in a month – we can accomodate only 2 a month for bully-reasons, but they can reapply)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Selection for departments</h3>
We, the board of the Alliance, have decided that every new member will have their choice of department taken as a high priority. There has to be a strong case (and the member has to be at least semi-happy with the appeal after) to appeal against someone joining a department. There is no room limit, however if the appeal is based on projects a new project/clone of the project (that the member wants to do) will be created. We also ask that some members may have to join two departments in case of low numbers (all members can choose their second dept.).
<h2>Part 2 – Member Privileges</h2>
All members shall have the following privileges:
<ul>
 	<li>Ability to use the site</li>
 	<li>Ability to have unlimited photo and media storage (however their personal media MUST be in separate albums)</li>
 	<li>Ability to become part of whatever dept (provided they are not already in the maximum amount of groups their level states)</li>
 	<li>Ability to use the blogs, forums, activity streams and emails</li>
</ul>
