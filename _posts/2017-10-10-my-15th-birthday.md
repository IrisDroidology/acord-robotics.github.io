Today is my 15th birthday, and I am having a great day. My favourite present so far: My littlebitsÂ R2-D2, which I got with mum from Harvey Norman.

Building R2 with my dad was a cool experience because he also seemed committed to helping me achieve my goal of finishing him.

I also came up with a cool plan - since I have so many games that I love to play as part of DroidOS, I can't play them all the time. Here are the best DroidOS games:
<ul>
 	<li>Pokemon TCG Online</li>
 	<li>Droid Inventor (littlebits R2-D2)</li>
 	<li>SW Commander</li>
 	<li>Dawn of Mars</li>
 	<li>Galaxy on Fire</li>
 	<li>MC</li>
 	<li>Force Collection</li>
 	<li>SW Force Builder</li>
 	<li>Hades' Star</li>
 	<li>Merchants of Space</li>
 	<li>VEGA Conflict</li>
 	<li>DragonML</li>
 	<li>Aven Colony</li>
</ul>
So why don't I have a schedule? Here are the games that are multiplayer and therefore I have to play depending on attacks and whatnot:
<ul>
 	<li>PTCGO</li>
 	<li>SWC</li>
 	<li>GOF</li>
 	<li>FC</li>
 	<li>HS?</li>
 	<li>VC</li>
 	<li>SW Combine</li>
</ul>
So I can play those games once every few days!

I will post my schedule with my passwords for the AoD accounts on my droid builder account.

Also more games will come, along with screenshots in my droid builder account.

Thanks and happy birthday to me!!!
