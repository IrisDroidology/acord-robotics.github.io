All users/droidlings are able to have email accounts with the domain name being @alliancceofdroids.org.au, for example limosine@allianceofdroids.org.au

To get one of these, all you have to do is comment down below your username (if you want your username to be your email prefix) or something else.

We will send you a message via the portal with your log-in details!

Many thanks, Limo
