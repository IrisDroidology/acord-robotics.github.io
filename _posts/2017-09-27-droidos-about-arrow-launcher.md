Arrow Launcher is a great, free launcher for Android phones and tablets (no iOS, sorry). What is a launcher? A launcher is an application that customizes your home screen, app layout &amp; drawers, icons, wallpapers, widgets, pages, your application dock, and so much more. You can choose what to customize and what to leave alone.

In fact, Samsung, Asus, and other android tech developers have their own launchers (Samsung: Touch Wiz Home) to customize your phone/tablet to their standards, but YOU can choose to keep their launcher or to update it.

But this post isn't about advertising launchers, it is about how Arrow Launcher is integrated into DroidOS for Android.

Remember, there are ways to customize iOS to make it DroidOS, but we will be covering that in a later post (sometime these holidays).

How do we use Arrow to turn your Android phone or tablet into a Droid machine? Easy - we log into our various microsoft accounts. Using these accounts we can quickly - and easily - access our droid documents. <strong>(Remember, put your droid docs on THIS WEBSITE AND on microsoft word/excel, etc.)</strong>

When you first install Arrow, it tells you to log in to your microsoft account. You can access your droid calendar, documents, and much more. Customize it to be your own droid!

Also, I will be uploading a link to the premium version of snap swipe drawer onÂ myÂ <strong>droidfolio</strong>. Droid Builders, if you do not have @IrisDroidology as a friend, do it now!

Also, here is who has access to being a friend of the Droidfolio (you can still be my friend on my personal account, @DroidologyIris):
<ul>
 	<li>Every droid builder</li>
 	<li>Every dept. leader (excluding management roles. Add @DroidologyIris as a friend)</li>
 	<li>Everyone that has helped build a droid, design it or review plans and make changes</li>
</ul>
Snap Swipe Drawer is an easy way to have widgets in your notifications bar, as well as apps shortcuts. Here is a list of apps we recommend:
<ul>
 	<li>Website widget (to view your profile in the drawer)</li>
 	<li>App lockers (any one, to protect your droid drawer - it is your droidfolio)</li>
 	<li>Zooniverse - droid builders (you can be added as a collaborator</li>
 	<li>More to come</li>
</ul>
On my droidfolio, I will post some photos of my droid drawer.

Thanks! #GoDroids!
