Hi everyone, just wanting to say that I am working on a new story called Space Quest with my dad and hopefully soon other members of the AoD. Here is the prologue:

&nbsp;
<p data-p-id="f3c1eb66d0972d1bac9b7ce199b9b9f9">It had been 400 years since scientists had first found out that without an atmosphere we would not be able to live on the Earth, and in just 4 short centuries the Earth was uninhabitable. It was a huge blow to the biosphere and to the Earthlings. There were only 2000 people that had survived the destruction of the habitability of our home planet, along with the DNA of every species documented.</p>
<p data-p-id="9ebb5c45cc9a88df1abf2f6dd099ebef">The humans had been trying to save the Earth for 200 years, but just 50 years of the industrial/computer era was enough for it to be too little, too late. There was too much heat, too much nuclear waste (thanks to the Great Nuclear War of 2120), and far too much pollution. There was also the fact that Mother Nature's law - to survive and prosper at all costs - had obviously worked against our planet, with the population of species being far too high for the Earth to be sustainable.</p>
<p data-p-id="59244b9dd987e240bdf7c36d3187041c">Of course, there was hope. There were over 800 space ships in orbit around the Earth, containing 2000 of the Earth's best scientists, ecologists, doctors, farmers, and astronauts. All of them would work together to protect the human race. But first they had to find a home, and fast.</p>
<p data-p-id="c51c0f4b8b42182e791948b6884cc81b">One home would be too risky. The same thing could happen to their second home as what had happened to their first. They decided to send out plant-like robots to different planets and star systems, to detect if there were any that could support life.</p>
<p data-p-id="9a74e9cf6730010785d1641c66c04719">Humans had mastered the power of wormholes, however they took over 6 months to prepare. The survivers decided to set up temporary farms on the stations they were on and then power down (go into an artificial sleep) until the wormholes were ready. The space telescopes would detect possible habitable planets.</p>
<p data-p-id="350a9937db3534ea5c0ceb4c94831b32">The humans had their work cut out for them. Setting up the farms was a massive process considering only the massive space stations would be big enough, climate controlled, etc. The team wanted to keep at least half (2) of the space stations for emergency purposes, so there were 2 space stations that were able to be put to the task. They calculated that with a 200-square-meter indoor sports field on each station, they could obviously have 400 square meters of farmland. They needed a bunch of water and also needed fertilizer and food.</p>
<p data-p-id="1903d28f77eb2c56f161e474e40de64f">It would be a massive engineering and agricultural effort for just 2,000 people, however, they had to get it done or else the human race would become extinct.</p>
