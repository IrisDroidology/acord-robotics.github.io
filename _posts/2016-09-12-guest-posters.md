<p style="text-align: justify;">We have had a large increase in members recently, and I know that some of them have their own disabilities or problems/struggles that they go through every day. This gave me a great idea: I could have some of these members blog about their experiences and about their daily life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyone is able to do this, regardless of why you want to do it. Here are a few rules and guidelines:</p>

<ol>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Every blogger must create an introduction post, explaining who they are and why they are posting here. You do not have to include personal information!</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">No references to friends' personal information without permission</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Respect everyone who blogs on the site and don't make them feel bad because of who they are</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Don't advertise, say things that are racist, sexist, discriminative, or otherwise insulting</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">You have a warning system: one warning every month, then banning.</li>
</ol>
I have a friend at my school who has a muscle disorder, and it impacts his life a lot. I am inspired by how he lives with it and want others to share their stories.
