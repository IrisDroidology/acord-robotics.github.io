I have been collecting Star Wars collectibles for 5 years and have spent hundreds on them. It started when I went through a phase of wanting to be like my dad and decided to get into star wars like he was in his teenage years. Since then, I have collected many pieces of lego and otherwise. My first set was the Snowtrooper battle pack, Â Lego 2011, which my dad got me when he came back from America for work. @liamaod @LieutenantDroid
