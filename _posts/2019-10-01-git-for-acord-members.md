<p>One of the main things that ACORD does is create a number of different types of software. This software includes games, utility apps and work tools. As all of our software is open-source - that is, it is free and can be freely accessed by the public to make changes to it - we need some sort of Git Client.</p>

<h2>What is Git?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. </p><cite>wikipedia.org</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Git allows us to view changes to all files in the code, as well as to release documentation through a wiki and determine problems with code using code quality, issues and pull requests.</p>

<h2>What is Github?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GitHub is an American company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git. It is a subsidiary of Microsoft, which acquired the company in 2018 for $7.5 billion. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GitHub offers plans for free, professional, and enterprise accounts. Free GitHub accounts are commonly used to host open source projects. As of January 2019, GitHub offers unlimited private repositories to all plans, including free accounts.[8] As of May 2019, GitHub reports having over 37 million users and more than 100 million repositories (including at least 28 million public repositories), making it the largest host of source code in the world.</p>

<h2>Who at ACORD needs Git?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pretty much everything ACORD does is through Git, either using Github or Gitlab. All our website backups will eventually be hosted on our Gitlab repository, and each member will have their profile stored safely and securely on the Git server. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently ACORD employs about 5 people, including myself. While we have more members, we only have 5 active right now. These 5 people are in the following departments:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Development</li><li>Writing</li><li>Administration</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There will be a post about these departments coming soon to the portal. I'd recommend checking back here soon to check that out. Each of the above departments requires Git in some way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>What do I need?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For members working on the development side of things, you need to:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Install Git</li><li>Glo by Gitkraken</li><li>Install GitKraken (desktop git client)</li><li>Sign up for a github &amp; gitlab account</li><li>Message me so I can add you to the departments on each Git server</li><li>Visual Studio Code</li><li>Unity 3D</li><li>Python 3</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For other members, you just need to have GitKraken and be part of our department on Github and Gitlab.</p>
