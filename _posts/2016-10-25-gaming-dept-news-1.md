Hello members and readers of this blog, I hope you are well. In this post I am going to be talking about some upcoming gaming department opportunities that I think will be good for everyone.

Just quickly, join the Gaming Department and you can record gaming videos for our gaming channel and more!

First up, Minecraft. Minecraft has been one of the most popular, most downloaded games ever, and plenty of people still play it, including me. I was thinking of getting a small Minecraft server for members of the Alliance of Droids, where we can have a small Hermitcraft-style survival map, a creative map, and maybe some mini-games like spleef. Any member is allowed to play on this server.

Members of the gaming department are able to get the special ranks on the server, like Trusted, Legend, [Mob Name], and more. These members are also allowed to record videos of the gameplay on the server.

This is a completely hypothetical idea that may or may not happen, but I will try my best to create this server. Only KNOWN members will be able to view the IP address, so we can limit the amount of spammers that try and play/hack our server.

Next we have the Steam Community Group. A lot of you may have heard of Steam (www.steampowered.com). It is basically a huge community of gamers, where you can buy games, collect achievements, badges, and items, and sell/trade them with other players. One of the cool things we can do is have a group - the Alliance of Droids Steam Community group. It is free to sign up with a Steam account, so all members can be part of our Steam group. Make sure your display name is set to your username so we know who you are. Your display name is different to your steam username - go to profile and find the display name option. Once you are part of the group, you are free to change your display name later.
