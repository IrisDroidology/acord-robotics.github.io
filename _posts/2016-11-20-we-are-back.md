<h1 style="text-align: center;">Finally!</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, finally we are back online - well, we have been since Friday, but I still haven't posted anything since then. What took so long, you ask? Notice anything about our domain? Yes, we are back to .ORG.AU, and we keep all our stuff, how awesome is that?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I still haven't updated the Facebook page, but I am pretty sure that the .com -&gt; .org.au redirect will still work, so even if you type in allianceofdroids.com itÂ <em>should</em> redirect to .org.au.</p>
