Hello, droidlings. Just a quick update about the portal being backed up. The portal (and the database) is backed up now, on the AoiPoD, my PC, and soon on Onedrive. \

Droid Builders, message @DroidologyIris (http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/droidlings/droidologyiris/ to get the passwords and usernames.
