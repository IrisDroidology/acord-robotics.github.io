<p>I've been really getting into development, and in this post I'm going to share my setup, applications and knowledge on development, gaming and writing. </p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>My Computer (Desktop)</h4>

<h2>What do I do on the PC?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I do plenty of cool stuff on my PC. But one of the reasons why I purchased my PC was because I wanted to game. I had a laptop (the Lenovo) but it failed spectacularly when it came to gaming on anything other than Minecraft (which is an awesome game by the way). I've spent a lot of money on games (especially on Steam) and I never really got to play them. This was for a few reasons:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Lack of storage - my laptop only had 256 gb of space, and most of the games I play take up at least 10 gigabytes</li><li>Lack of graphics card - my laptop only had an inbuilt card, nothing fancy like an Nvidea. This severely impacted the performance</li><li>Lack of keytravel - when I'm gaming, I prefer to have a large amount of keytravel. Obviously a laptop doesn't</li><li>Internet problems - my laptop was noticeably slow when it came to download/upload speeds</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I decided, around about last year, that I was going to try and get a gaming computer. Currently I play a few games on it:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>No Man's Sky</li><li>Minecraft</li><li>Starbound</li><li>Just Cause 3</li><li>Space Engineers</li><li>Master of Orion (deluxe)</li><li>Eve Online</li><li>Take on Mars</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also develop applications and programs using my PC. Like with gaming, I need to have a somewhat beefy PC to be able to use software like Unity &amp; GitKraken. I need to use Unity for school - Computer Science - and I also want to learn how to develop, as I want to be a developer. It's sort of hard to do that on what isn't meant to be a developer's laptop.</p>

<h3>Git</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is git?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes  in source code during software development. It is designed for  coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes  in any set of files. </p><cite>Wikipedia</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3 of the most common git apps are Github, Gitlab &amp; Bitbucket (by Atlassian). Think of git as a place where you create "repositories" - basically folders for projects. On Github, for example, you have a files section, an issue/discussion tab, and a lot more (see below image below):</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I use Github &amp; Gitlab everyday (currently I'm on a 168 day streak) for coding on different repositories, including the <a href="http://github.com/irisdroidology/unityballs">Asteroid Dodgers</a> repository, which is a game I'm creating on my PC using the Unity game engine. My PC is really useful for this, because the games I create render automatically. </p>

<h3>What does my physical setup look like?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My physical setup has remained relatively the same since I purchased my PC, which was in April of this year. I purchased the Fredde desk from Ikea (yes, I subscribe). Here's a pic: </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> I've been really getting into development </p><cite>Liam Arbuckle</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I code in a variety of languages, including Python, HTML, CSS, and C++/C#. I've got a bit of experience in Python, and at the moment I'm following a few tutorials on Udemy and LearnPython.org to better my understanding of Python. I have 2 monitors at the moment (27" AOC and a curved Samsung 32+"), but at the moment I'm using the Samsung, which I got a few days ago. It's really good because I can arrange my windows like this:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can see, I've got a few applications open here:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Microsoft Visual Studio Code</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the left of the screen, I have Microsoft Visual Studio Code (I'll call it VSCode from now on). I originally planned to use the regular version of Visual Studio, but when I discovered the extensions available on VSCode (including Github integration), I ditched the old app in favour of the new one. I use VSCode for most of my programming, the only exception is when I'm coding on Bootstrap sites (an example of which would be my temporary site http://irisdroidology.github.io/portfolio (or http://acord.tech/portfolio)) and I use Brackets.io (by Adobe) for Bootstrap editing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it's late afternoon/nighttime, I prefer to us the Bluloco Dark Italics theme for VSCode (seen in the image below), while at other times I use the Arduino-inspired theme (seen above).</p>

<h3>Typora</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A large part of Github (and Git sites in general) is the markdown file. Your project readme is written in markdown, and if you use Jekyll, your files will be markdown as well. I write my notes in Typora, which is a markdown client. The reason for this is because my notes are stored on a Jekyll (static site generator) site - http://irisdroidology.github.io/python-learning. This means that my notes can be presented in an easy way on the site. Typora is seen in the top right of the first image.</p>
