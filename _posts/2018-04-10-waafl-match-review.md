On Sunday (8th March) I played my first match at the new Optus Stadium, and my second curtain raiser overall. I played with my mate Kevin on the Integrated team, while my local team's skippers (Geoff Stewart &amp; Tyler Gould) played with the All Stars.

We kicked the first point of the game,
<ul>
 	<li>In the first quarter, after I set up a touch in the forward 50. Shortly after, in the next quarter, the All Stars hit back and scored a goal. I was getting frustrated with the coachâ€™s game plan. Yes, when we have the ball we need to scatter away from the defenders, however we couldnâ€™t kick 100% straight, so if we let our defenders move too far away from us, they could get an easy uncontested mark.</li>
 	<li>In the third quarter, we kicked two more points to wrestle back momentum, but the All Stars kicked 2 in the early stages of the Last Quarter. However, I was feeling better (Iâ€™d had touches in every quarter and was playing good footy), when suddenly I received a goal assist. (for #11) We were 1 point down, with just over a minute to play (we had 15 mins per quarter, including stoppages, so we could see on the big screens).</li>
 	<li>Suddenly, after the centre clearance I handpassed and found a teammate, and we kicked it into Jason (#6). We were in front (4.4.28 to 3.5.23) with less than 10 seconds to go!</li>
 	<li>The team photo was fun, and it was great to make up with all my teammates.</li>
</ul>
