On #ForceFriday Star Wars announced that they had released a new droid (R2-D2) set from littlebits (http://littlebits.cc) where you could easily build your own droid. I was thinking that we could have it as a small companion for our larger companion droids (Sp-D2/A0-D1, R3-S6/Sp~S6/A0-D2).

The site is available here:Â https://shop.littlebits.cc/pages/starwars?_ga=2.240005571.1378779457.1504660256-1300618760.1504239723

We can buy it from the Apple shop:Â https://www.apple.com/au/shop/product/HLFP2Z/A/littlebits-droid-inventor-kit?afid=p238%7CsmC6Ye47V-dc_mtid_18707vxu38484_pcrid_55471952566_&amp;cid=aos-au-kwgo-pla-brand-product-HLFP2

We can also use him on the Free App.

Lastly, we can control him via @AoiPhoneD, @AoiPoD, and @AoTab//SleekTab
