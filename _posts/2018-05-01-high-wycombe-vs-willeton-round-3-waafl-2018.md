On Saturday I played my third game for the season, which we lost 84 - 60 (12.12 - 9.6).

My stats -
<ul>
	<li>1 goal (our first and my first in the league) - shortly before half time. Geoff (skipper) had taken the crumb and snapped it through, but since I had been slung in the tackle advantage wasn't paid.</li>
	<li>4 tackles - 1 of those pushed the player out of bounds. It was classed as deliberate, however I kicked it and Garry stumbled, it went straight to the Wycombe player and he kicked truly.</li>
	<li>I had about 12 disposals, most of them in the 2nd and 3rd term.</li>
	<li>I also had a few marks.</li>
</ul>
