<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Member "Wall" &amp; Media</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to BuddyBoss, I have been able to make the profile pages look so much nicer and so much better. You can now add a cover image to your profile, and you also have a Facebook-style WALL that can show status updates and much more. You can also upload media - videos, photos, documents &amp; more - so other people will be able to see your work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are other plug-ins that we want to add to change the style of the profile page, and you guys are able to contact us with ideas or plug-ins.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">BuddyBoss Theme, Templates, &amp; more</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The BuddyBoss theme is notable because it is optimized for BuddyPress. We have a slide-out sidebar on the left that shows important information about your profile, and can be hidden or shown by clicking the button at the top left (the one with three lines).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sidebar on the right has also had some new additions. There are different sidebars shown on different page types, and the widget to download our app is up as well. The app is not on the App Store/Google Play Store. Instead you download and open the .apk file on your device. Wait for it to download. Follow the instructions and you will be fine. The app is still being developed so it is not the last update!</p>
