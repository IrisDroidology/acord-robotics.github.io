The AoiPhoneÂ is my current phone (an iPhone 5s) and will be the secondary control mechanism (iDroidOS) for A0-D2 and the other droids (all other droids, not just the CD's, because technically all droids are CD's in a way).

Read this link to find out more:Â <a href="http://links.allianceofdroids.org.au/droidfriends">links.allianceofdroids.org.au/droidfriends</a>

Basically, it will be using R2-Touch and some other droid building apps.

To control in via the AoTab, AoiPoD, and vice versa, we need to jailbreak it.

CYDIA is coming for iOS 11 soon. Our AoiPhone is currently on iOS 11.0.2

However, we can always downgrade to iOS 10 to get some other awesome tweaks (like Veency).
