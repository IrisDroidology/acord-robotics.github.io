<h1>The Old Theme</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last year in September, Sean &amp; I bought the legacy version of Thrive from Theme forest, coded by http://dunhakdis.com. Over the past year, the team at Dunhakdis have been busy creating a new version of Thrive that works with Buddypress 3.0, which was the 10th anniversary of Buddypress.</p>

<h1>Differences in the new theme</h1>
The main difference in the profile section is when you go to your DB profile, the menu is in two places - to the right of the activity section, and in the slide-out menu. These widgets/nav-menus are only visible on DB profiles.

The other differences include:
<ul>
	<li>Menu changes - three by three square button = main menu, click to view main menu, or hit the hamburger button to the right of the logo to view the widgets and the second menu</li>
	<li>Menu changes - Shopping cart, Notifications, Inbox, BP links</li>
	<li>Menu changes - colour changes - now aqua and purple</li>
</ul>
