<p style="text-align: justify;">Essendon have again been victorious at the MCG, scraping past Geelong with a decent 17 point victory, after being forty points up at 3 quarter time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Essendon had to withstand four consecutive goals from Geelong, but in the inaugural Country game Essendon stayed strong and kicked a few late goals to seal the victory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joe Daniher kicked 5 goals and took a screamer of a mark and was the best on ground.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was happy with the game and stayed up to watch it all on the TV.</p>
