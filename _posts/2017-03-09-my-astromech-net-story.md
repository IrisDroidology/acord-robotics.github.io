<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi there! I'm back again with another post on my Droid blog. Today I am going to be talking about the highs and lows of my R2-D2 Builders Club story. Let's begin!</p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FIRST ACCOUNT - R2D211</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My first account was creating around November/December 2014, when I was searching for the R2-D2 Fan Club. I made hardly any posts and then when I made my first droid, Sp-D2, I accidentally posted it on this account.</p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SECOND ACCOUNT - Alliance of Droids</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I formed the Alliance of Droids with my cousin, we decided to create an Astromech.net account with the name Alliance of Droids, which was completely off-topic. I ended up getting banned permanently on the account Ao-D2 (my third account) AND this account. I believe that that was fair.</p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CURRENT ACCOUNT - Dogs &amp; Droids</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the account that I currently use, started in June 2016 with a current total of 66 posts.</p>
