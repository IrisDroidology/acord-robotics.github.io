<p>Something that a few people that follow our news have complained about is the lack of a detailed mailing system. While subscribers to our blog get our latest posts in their inbox (thanks Wordpress), there are some features missing from this primitive system. Because of this I've been searching around for plugins that work with Wordpress for this purpose. And the answer that I've found is pretty popular - you may have heard of it. It's Mailchimp.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Mailchimp is a marketing automation platform and an email marketing service. The platform is a trading name of its operator, Rocket Science Group, an American company founded in 2001 by Ben Chestnut and Mark Armstrong, with Dan Kurzius joining at a later date. </p><cite>Wikipedia</cite></blockquote>

<p>MailChimp was chosen by ACORD for a number of reasons - it's free, it's easy to use and it is compatible with Wordpress &amp; Woocommerce. I've written a full review of the Mailchimp family on my blog, which is linked at the bottom of the page. </p>
