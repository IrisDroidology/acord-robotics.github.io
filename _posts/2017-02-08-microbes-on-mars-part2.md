<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier;">WHERE WE LEFT OFF LAST TIME</span></h1>
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier;">Yesterday, in my first blog post on the new series, we touched a bit on the subject of Mars &amp; microbial life there. I have been studying life on Mars since late 2013, and new information is coming in every week. In today's blog post we will be looking at actual evidence of possible life on Mars that could exist TO THIS DAY.</span>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier;">MARS: Is it a dead planet?</span></h1>
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier;">Recently, evidence of liquid water on the surface of Mars has changed the view on life from a very slight possibility to "more than likely." By that I mean that there was most likely life on Mars at SOME POINT IN ITS LIFETIME, and there still may be life now.Â </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier;">Mars has often been called a dead planet - nothing grows, no animals live there, etc. etc. But before the first man-made space missions arrived at Mars, many professional scientists embraced the possibility of INTELLIGENT life. They even went as far as to state the possibility of the so-called Martian canals - which was the result of a mis-translation that 'proved' intelligent life on Mars.Â </span>
