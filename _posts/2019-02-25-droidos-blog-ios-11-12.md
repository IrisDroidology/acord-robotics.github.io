<h1>Welcome to the DroidOS Blog!</h1>
Today in the first post in the DroidOS Blog, I'm going to be talking about the iOS 12/11 Jailbreaks and what it means for our current AoiPhone, the iPhone 5s (from 2013).
<h1>Youtube Templates (iOS 11/12 Jailbreaks)</h1>

<h1>Why do we jailbreak?</h1>
iOS just isn't as customizable as Android, and it is hard for us to create DroidOS templates for iOS devices. The other thing is that we plan to remotely control our droids. The problem is that Scroo.B (our companion robot AKA A0-D2) will have a few control panels, stuck to the front of the robot. This is because they are plugged into the electronics. To remotely control our robots we need to jailbreak our devices as they can't be operated remotely out of the box.

Some great themes can be installed using Cydia, which is sort of the app store for jailbroken themes, tweaks and apps.

There's a bunch of videos linked here which show off some themes. I'll add more in the 2nd post.

Have a good day.
