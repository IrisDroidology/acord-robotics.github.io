<p style="text-align: justify">The Alliance of Droids is releasing a new podcasting series. You will be able to listen to a verbal account of our posts while you are at the gym, at work, at school, you name it. The Droidcasts are free to download, and when we get our app sorted out, you will be able to play it from the app as well. The Droidcasts will be about 10-40 minutes long, depending on how much time we have to record. Myself and some other members will be in the podcasts, and all members will be able to send in a small audio recording that they want to be in a future Droidcast.
