<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, I am back with my blog and at the moment am trying to find a new game to buy on Steam with my dad. I know that I really like the idea of No Man's Sky, but not all of the reviews are good, and the price-tag is expensive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Space Engineers seems like another good choice, at $24.99 US Dollars; I will get to build a planetary base, space stations, space ships and more. It would be great if I could find a companion version for a mobile device, which it probably won't.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here is an email I sent to my dad, who is going to buy the game. (Unfortunately he thinks gaming is horrible, games himself, and promises me the games but it takes forever for him to cave in...).</p>

<div><span style="color: #00ffff;">Space Engineers: Basically Space Engineers is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. Players build space ships, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored.Â <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/?snr=1_237_237__201" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=http://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/?snr%3D1_237_237__201&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1471765383758000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFsi7LegqIQqqaGWKpIj9w7uq5IvA">$24.99 USD on steam (located at this steam link!)</a>Â VERY VERY POSITIVE REVIEWS</span></div>
<div></div>
<div>What steam is: Steam is a digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation offering digital rights management (DRM), multiplayer gaming and social networking services. Steam provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games on multiple computers, and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game voice and chat functionality. The software provides a freely available application programming interface (API) called Steamworks, which developers can use to integrate many of Steam's functions into their products, including networking, matchmaking, in-game achievements, micro-transactions, and support for user-created content through Steam Workshop.</div>
<div>Though initially developed for use on Microsoft Windows, versions for OS X and Linux operating systems were later released. Applications whose main functions are chatting and shopping have also been released for iOS, Android and Windows Phone mobile devices. The Steam website also replicates much of the storefront and social network features of the stand-alone application.</div>

<div><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/383120" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=http://store.steampowered.com/app/383120&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1471765383758000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpZdf6DAWq7uXnhwxabKGNDnUHWQ">This game is 50% off - space colony game</a>. In it you go around, killing or befriending aliens and building space ports. Not the best choice but has very positive reviews.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">GRAV is a sand box experience where you explore a multitude of planets, hunt strange alien creatures, build and defend outposts, craft weapons and armor, and attempt to survive against other players in a hostile environment.Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">We here at BitMonster has been working on GRAV for about 5 months and feel that getting the community involved earlier is vital to a great game. We plan to launch GRAV as Early Access and work closely with the community on how we evolve and move GRAV forward!Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Note: these are features already in the game. They may be fleshed out more in the future, but they will be ready to rock from day 1Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Endless Worlds - The planets of GRAV are procedurally generated from composite parts. This allows for a near infinite combination of biomes, alien sites, and dungeons.Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Gorgeous Visuals - Genre re-defining visuals allow you to experience fear, excitement, and trepidation in a way never seen before.Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Frenzied Combat - Compared to the zen-like calm of harvesting resources, combat is a wild ride which you can only hope to survive. Both Melee and Shooting are the tools of death in GRAV.Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Player vs Player - Create alliances with other players, viciously kill them and take their belongings, or run from it all! It's up to you how you interact with your fellow players.Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Play With Friends - GRAV is all about enjoying the experience with your friends. GRAV is client-server based so put up a server or join an official one!Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Powerful Base Construction - Supporting a modular contextual room based construction system allows for building bases quickly. GRAV's building system can be used for creating an entire city, a quick base to fight off enemy players, or building an outpost deep in a dungeon to defend against the aggressive hordes.Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Extensive Crafting - Anything you can harvest or kill has a chance to drop Crafting Materials. Building everything from the armor you wear, weapons you kill with, to the actual bases themselves comes from crafting.Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Dynamic Environmental Events - GRAV employs a procedural system to create world events for players. A night could consist of blossoming night flowers, meteors raining down from the heavens, or even a horde of very angry alien wildlife trying to kill you and anything you have ever made.Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Procedurally Generated Dungeons - The planets of GRAV are full of dungeons that are created specifically for that planet. Full of rare resources, dangerous foes, and environmental obstacles that provide a high-risk high-reward play area.Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Hostile Environments - Alien planets have a combination of semi safe areas and just plain you-are-probably-going to die locations! The planets of GRAV are places where you must do whatever it takes to survive.Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Roadmap to get an idea of what features are coming to GRAV:Â </span></div>
