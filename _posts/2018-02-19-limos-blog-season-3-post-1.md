Hello, and welcome to this first main post in season 3 of Limo's Blog on the Alliance of Droids portal.

I stopped doing long, 2 page + posts over a year ago, so I figured that I should start again in Limo's Blog.

<h1 style="text-align: center;">THE SPORTS SECTION!</h1>
In this section (which I will do in most of the posts in this series), I will be talking about a few things:
<ul>
	<li>My favourite sports teams (Essendon - AFL, Everton - BPL, etc.)</li>
	<li>My footy team (Willeton Integrated)</li>
	<li>Sports news</li>
</ul>
Let's get started!
<h3>Essendon FC - News &amp; Games</h3>
Last week, the new AFL-X debuted, which was a form of Aussie rules with a rectangular field and a shorter pitch. Essendon lost both of our games that we played (against Hawthorn &amp; Saint Kilda), but we played a lot of our young blood.

Essendon were the real winners in last year's trade period, we received:
<ul>
	<li>Jake Stringer (previously Western Bulldogs)</li>
	<li>Adam Saad (previously Gold Coast Suns)</li>
	<li>Devon Smith (previously GWS Giants)</li>
</ul>

This season, I have predicted Essendon to finish in the top 6, if we finish 1st, 2nd, 5th or 6th, we will have a guaranteed home final in the first round, if we finish 3rd or 4th we will get a home game in the second round we play in.

Last year, we finished 7th but were bundled out of the finals by my arch-rivals Sydney (formerly South Melbourne FC) by 65 points.

This year, I hope we can win a final for the first time since 2004 (against West Coast). We could even get through to the grand final (we haven't since 2001, against Brisbane. We last won a grand final in 2000 (by 60 points) against Melbourne).

&nbsp;

P.S. I won't be talking about Everton this post for two reasons:
<ul>
	<li>I don't follow them anywhere near as much as I do Essendon</li>
	<li>I haven't prepared anything for this post</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>My Football Club</h3>
Last week (on Thursday) we had our second training session, and we received confirmation we will be playing in our first carnival in March. We have a few new players (enough to play some games, anyway), and I'm looking forward to the carnival.

<h1 style="text-align: center;">The School Life Section!</h1>
This year, I'm going into Year 10 at Perth Modern School. I vowed last year to do better with my core subjects, and looking at the amount of study I have been doing these first 3 weeks, I am right on track.

This semester, I'm doing the following subjects:
<ul>
	<li>Philosophy</li>
	<li>Science</li>
	<li>Math (pre-methods)</li>
	<li>English ATAR (accelerated YEAR 11 subject)</li>
	<li>Photography</li>
	<li>Modern History</li>
	<li>Engineering</li>
</ul>
Next post, I will be talking about MATH (PRE-METHODS)

<hr />

Next post, we will be talking about:
<ul>
	<li>Sports</li>
	<li>Science</li>
</ul>
Enjoy!
