<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">What are member jobs?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">This new series, member jobs, is about what our members can do to help out, both with the Alliance of Droids and in general. We talk about projects, raising awareness, and people who we think are in need.Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Today we are going to be talking about raising awareness, and also our projects.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Raising Awareness</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">1 in 68 people in Australia are born with Autism. People on the Autism Spectrum have unique features, qualities, and habits. Not all of these are good, and not all of these are bad. The world is a better place with people who are on the Spectrum, or have AD/HD, or have physical disabilities, etc. It reminds us that we are all the same because we are all unique.Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">But some people forget this. Too many people. People with AS get bullied considerably more than most others. Before a diagnosis, no-one can explain why this child has bad habits. Not too long ago, people with AS and other disabilities were locked up in an asylum because they were thought to be mad, the devil, etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">How can we change this? We want to teach people about WHY these kids are different, and that it is not a bad thing. We want to make it easier to accept a diagnosis and help people come to terms with what to do, and don't make them blame people. A lot of parents blame it on vaccinations. People like to blame people, or things, for their misfortune.Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Wouldn't it be awesome to get rid of all this, and make everyone become a community?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">This is why I started the My Disabled Life Series. Others can publish their own stories about their experiences/disability. This makes it more accepting and people are braver to stand up for themselves.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Projects</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">One of our projects has already been mentioned - raising awareness. We have many more where that came from! One of the main ones is similar to raising awareness - getting more members. Recruiting new members is one of the best ways to raise awareness because we can get more people involved. This shows that more people are involved, including kids.Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">We also, obviously, want to make things for people. Especially kids with disabilities. Every member is entitled to commenting on this post if they know of anyone who may be eligible for this. This is like Make A Wish, but it is different because it is run by people who know what it is like to be bullied, ignored, disabled.Â <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We</span> are disabled. This is for disabled kids, not just kids with terminal illnesses. We understand that we can't grant wishes that are incredibly expensive, but we can create small woodwork models like cars, trucks, cats, etc. It may not seem much but it will show the kid that someone cares, and it will mean a lot to them. We may be selling these on the shop. We will include a letter of admiration and well-wishing, and the model.Â </span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">What can the members do?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">As this seriesÂ <em>isÂ </em>titled MEMBER JOBS, you would expect that this post is for members to know what to do, and this is no exception. We would like all members to raise awareness about disabilities. Whether this may be writing on their blog, our blog, or just talking to someone who has a disability, this is all good and means a lot to me, and all of us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">People who do things like Wood-work, Craft, etc. are eligible to make things - projects - for us, like mentioned above.</span></p>
