<p style="text-align: justify;">All members who are participating in the Droid Contest are able to request a role upgrade so they can access the Project Manager. The Project Manager is a plug-in that will allow you to create a project with to-do lists, forums, members, file sharing, and more. Just send me a private message and I'll do the rest!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If anyone else knows of a good plug-in that we could use (because, let's face it, P.M. is not full of features), send me a private message and I will trial it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again, all members can participate, and we have special judges that will judge the droids!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Prizes:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every team that created a droid gets a special carry-case for their droid or a special tool for your droid, for free!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every member that played a major part in building their droid gets the Droid Builder Rank!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Top three teams get to organize an operation!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Top three teams also get special edition badges; for example:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">::|Liam Arbuckle|Liam'z Droidz &amp; Co.|::</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alliance of Droids</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">[Also a picture of you and your droid]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other ideas for prizes should be sent via private message to me!</p>
