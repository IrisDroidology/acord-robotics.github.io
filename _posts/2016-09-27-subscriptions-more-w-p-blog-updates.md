I have finally downloaded a WordPress plug-in that will allow us to have member subscriptions, so you guys can have access to things that can be quite expensive and therefore we would need to receive money for it.

There are a few packages currently set up on this site:
<ul>
 	<li>Droid Builder Deluxe Package - Full Sized Droid. This package is good for members who want to build their own full-sized droid, receive parts, and more. $150 US</li>
 	<li>Droid Builder Deluxe Package - 1/2 OR 1/4 scale Droid. $125 US</li>
 	<li>Droid Builder Gold Package - Full Sized Droid. Comes with a year-long subscription to the droid magazine (full of tips and tricks for your droid - deluxe package comes with two-year subscription), some parts for your droid, and more. ALSO includesÂ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1/2 OR 1/4 scale droid package</span>. $110 US &amp; $100 US for the scale droids</li>
 	<li>Droid Builder Silver Package - Full Sized Droid. Comes with six months premium access to the droid magazine, with another six months of limited access. 1 part worth $80 or 2 parts worth $40 each. $75 US for Full Sized Droid.</li>
 	<li>Droid Builder Bronze Package. Comes with six months premium access to the droid magazine. 1 part worth $60. $60 for Full Sized Droid. Sorry, no scale droid package available.</li>
 	<li>Droid Starter Kit - Unlimited access to the droid magazine. Discounts on parts and tools. $80 US for D.S Kit &amp; extra $80 US ($160) to combine it with the Silver Package.</li>
 	<li>More to come!</li>
</ul>
All members get read-only access to the droid magazine - for the first couple of pages. Limited access means you have access to the whole magazine, with Copyright protection enabled. Premium access allows you to download the magazine, add stuff to it, and save stuff from the magazine into your drive.

There are going to be some more packages for other, non-droid related stuff.

Note that these parts were not made using the R2-D2 Builders Blueprints and as such we cannot be prosecuted for copyright infringement.

You can sign up using your PayPal info.
