Currently, I have not done any more work on the Scratch project as I have been really busy, but that is about to change. I have created the Scratch Studio "Droidfolio", available atÂ https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/3624091/projects/, and if you want to join in comment down below with your scratch username and the hashtag #DroidBuilder. You need to be a member to join and we need to be able to trust you.

In other news, I am currently writing a FanFiction on R3-S6, before the Clone Wars, After the Clone Wars, and during the Clone Wars.
