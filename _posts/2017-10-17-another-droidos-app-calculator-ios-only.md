A lot of the apps (Nova, Arrow, etc.) that I have talked about for DroidOS are Android only - no iOS versions. Unless you jailbreak your iDevice (and you shouldn't need to do this for the AoD unless you're a droid builder), you can't customize your iDevice much. However, here is an iOS-only app that is vouched for by the members of the board of the AoD and you can get for free!

Calculator+ is a great way to hide your AoD photos, videos, passwords, AoD contacts, and browse our website with no need to fear of hackers or external bullies. It is all hidden behind a calculator, which works, however when you put in your password and then his the % key, your vault is unlocked.

I am giving all members the ability to receive the password and email for my AppleID to download any premium DroidOS iOS apps for free (and also my gmail for premium DroidOS Android apps) including Calculator+ but we do have the ability to get all your stuff.

To get the app codes, message <a href="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/droidlings/droidologyiris">droidologyirisÂ </a>with:
<ul>
	<li>Why you need Calculator+ or other DroidOS apps</li>
	<li>That you promise to use it for mostly AoD stuff.</li>
</ul>
