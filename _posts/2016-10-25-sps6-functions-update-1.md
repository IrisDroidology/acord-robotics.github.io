<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">What is this update for?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">This update series is going to be about what we are planning to add to Sp~S6 &amp; the companion robots based on him, be it functions, parts, or something else. We plan to release these at least twice a month, so you will have plenty of content to check out.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">Today's Functions</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">Today I am going to be talking about the control panel/app, batteries, voice, and companion-a-bility. The first, the control panel/app, is going to be hopefully coming with the robots that we make. We want to have an easy-to-use way to create your own small functions for your robot. You will be able to code where the robot can go and what it can do. We are also be planning to add functionality for custom tools and the like. Using the control panel, you can talk to him, even when you aren't in the same room (hopefully even further than that).Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">The purpose of the companion robots is going to be to give people with disabilities a chance to have a friend to talk to and share their thoughts. You can even email him if you want to talk to him when you aren't near him. The robots will be able to interact with you in a semi-sentient way.Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">The design of our companion robots will be difficult to implement because everyone has different tastes and needs. We want to have them in two main sizes - small &amp; large. For Sp~S6, we are going to be taking parts from Sp-D2 to make a new droid. The functions we add to him will later be used in our full robots. We are using the parts from Sp-D2 that will look comforting to a child. We will be implementing an Arduino/MarcDuino system into Sp~S6. After we create the first companion robots, we will rebuild Sp~S6 into a companion robot that is unique and has all the same functions. This is important - he will go into the AoD hall of Fame (AoDHoF - ADHoF).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">The batteries will be held in place in a battery box and a harness. More information will become clear later.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">The voice may be able to be customized - specific accents, gender, etc. This may not happen but it would be good so that it is easy for the kid to understand. You can also customize the language. Having many different things to say and keep track of means that we can't pre-program him completely, although this may have to do (for now).</span></p>
