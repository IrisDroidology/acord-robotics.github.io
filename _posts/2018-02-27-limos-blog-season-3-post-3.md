<h3 style="text-align: center;">SPORTS SECTION</h3>
Essendon lost by about 80 points on the weekend to the reigning premiers, Richmond, in the preseason. Let me just explain why I'm not upset:
<ol>
	<li>It was theÂ <strong>preseason</strong></li>
	<li>Merret (our best young player) got concussed in the first 2 minutes</li>
	<li>Our best players had gastro</li>
	<li>Hooksy wasn't playing</li>
</ol>
Let's walk through them one at a time

It was the preseason. No-one cares about it. For example - in 2013 Brisbane won the preseason, and they finished near last, out of 18 teams. They finished last in 2017, 17th in 2016, 18th in 2015, 16th in 2014, etc. It doesn't matter - most teams don't play their best players and don't try - the risk of getting an injury so close to the season is too big. It would be better to get an ACL injury at the end of the first game of the real season, if you contribute to the win, than to get an ACL injury in the preseason.

Merret (Zach) was concussed. He joined us in 2014 and has averaged 25 touches ever since (elite, even for a midfielder). He inspires us and has won games that we thought were lost.

On the eve of the preseason, a number of our selected players were struck down with gastro, but they still played on.

Hooksy (Cale Hooker) was a defender but became a forward after kicking a goal against Hawthorn (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTyN0-nF59Y). He won our best and fairest in 2015 and is part of the leadership group.

So overall, I'm not upset about us losing - I didn't even watch the game.

The sports section for this post is #CLOSED.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Gaming Section</h3>
In today's gaming section, I will be talking about why I want to settle in a mesa biome in the next season of Mushlantis.

Mesa biomes are incredibly awesome: here are a few features -
<ul>
	<li>Gold mines</li>
	<li>Clay, red sand, *dead bushes*</li>
	<li>Awesome terrain and scenery</li>
	<li>Great for building</li>
</ul>
I will be connecting the mushroom biome to the mesa by an underground rail system, and also connecting the mesa to some nearby biomes by bridge (hopefully - I don't know where the mesa is. I will probably be doing a special episode at the end of Season 1 - exploring to find it).

We will be building a sort of rustic style of houses, using the terrain to our advantage. This was inspired by ReNDoG'sÂ Hermitcraft Season 4 "Lush Mesa" biome.

Season 3 will be in a jungle biome, and will be connected by another underground rail system.
<h3>Eventually they will also be connected by an enderporter (throwing ender pearls into water, which will send it to another district).</h3>
Season 4 will be the last season, and will be fixing up the jungle, mushroom biome and the mesa/desert. We will be starting a new Minecraft series (LimoLand) - but will continue to do mini-episodes of the Mushlantis world, showing our new subscribers our first world, as well as continuing to make it nice.

AoD members will get exclusive access to the download of Mushlantis. We want to continue using it, as there will be plenty of new updates for MCPE.

The Gaming Section is now #closed.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Media Section</h3>
I could not help feeling a bit disappointed about Star Wars VIII - The Last Jedi. It was one of my favourite of the SW movies (including the Clone Wars, Episode 4, 6), however this is what I want for the next installment:
<ul>
	<li>R2-D2 doing something special</li>
	<li>R2 dying, but passing over some sort of special thing (maybe data or a force crystal that allowed him to harness the force) to BB-8, making him the premier droid</li>
	<li>A happy ending</li>
</ul>
The media section is now #closed

<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Tech Section</h3>
Everyone has been talking about the new iPhone X's faceID camera, but I prefer the DroidID (fingerprint sensor *____* LOL). The Samsung S9 has the best of the best:Â <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Iris<em>Â </em></span>Scanner (droid builders know why), Face scanner, and the fingerprint sensor. I love all these things, as well as passwords.

I think that biometrics will eventually be more secure than a regular password, however I want to keep all of them, because they represent something to us Droid Builders.
