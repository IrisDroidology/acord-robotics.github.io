<h2>Out of internet</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hey everyone, first up I'd like to apologize for not being able to post for about a week. I was on holiday down south and had no internet.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">What is multisite?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WordPress Multisite is basically what we are planning to use so all of our members can have their own blogs, for example www.liamsblog.allianceofdroids.com. You guys will be the admins for your site, which means you can install plug-ins, change the theme, as long as the content on your site isn't against our terms and conditions. You may request your site on a future post - Your Blog.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Spamming &amp; Malware - S&amp;M</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would just like to say that this site has been very good with not attracting spam comments or malware embedded in our site. This may change when our site becomes bigger, but for now all is good. Remember that any comments that have ads, more than two links, rude or abusive language, or unrelated content, will be automatically deleted.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Theme Editing</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hopefully I will find enough time to edit a child theme to add some more functionality to our blog. For now, though, we will have to make do with this theme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To keep the content across all our sites clean, we will be allowing about 20 different themes for all our sites. If any of the members would like a different theme that they know of, they can contact me via private message on this website and I will get the theme ready. If it is a premium theme, I am willing to pay 50% of the cost of that theme.</p>
