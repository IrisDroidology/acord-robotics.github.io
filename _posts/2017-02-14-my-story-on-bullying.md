<p style="text-align: justify;">I have been bullied for a LONG time - longer than most people expect when they hear about me. Since I was 4 years old in my first year of school (I spent ONE year at that school) I have been bullied.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bullying is something that has been going on for EVER and needs to stop NOW. Bullies kill - the bullied die.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">My Story - Primary School K-Y3</h1>
My earliest memories of bullying were when I was in my first year of school. I was bullied because of my love for science - even then, I loved science (in fact, I did before then :).

I was bullied in my second year of Primary School, my first at my new school. I remember getting bullied, but I apologize because of the fact that I can't remember much of it - however, here is what I remember:
<p style="text-align: justify;">I used to get chased, laughed at and stalked by two or three year 7 girls in my first year at the new school. They would come to the gate on Monday-Thursday, and every Friday we went out to the rest of the school (we had our own special area). Even then, I couldn't help attracting the ladies (cough cough!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But seriously, I hated it. I told them to stop but they wouldn't. The main ways to tell if it is bullying or not is to look at these factors:</p>

<ol>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Is it being repeated?</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Have you told them to stop - and do they keep going?</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Is it hurtful to you?</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Does it discriminate against you or someone else?</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then in Year 1, I used to count a lot aloud - I started one night when I was bored and couldn't get to sleep - and this made me get bullied. Another thing that happened was I was ABSOLUTELY horrible at sport (at theÂ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">time</span>, not anymore :). This just fueled it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Year 2 the same sorts of things happened - but there were a few other problems (1. my sister spread rumours about me - not true 2. I was spending more time by myself - loner alert!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Year 3 was where it started to get bad.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I hope you enjoyed this introduction to my bullying story. Please keep an eye out for tomorrow's story on the same subject.</p>
