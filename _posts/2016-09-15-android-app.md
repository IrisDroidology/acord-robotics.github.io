Well. I have done it - created an app. At the moment, it's only for Android. You can download it here:

<a href="https://apkfileswordapp.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/apps/build/15115/15115-201609150609-release.apk " target="_blank">App Download</a>

If you have some sort of emulator on iOS to get the Play Store, you will be able to get it when I upload it to the Play Store!
