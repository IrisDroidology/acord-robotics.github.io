On June 11th, 2017, I will be playing my first game for the Willeton Integrated Football Club. This is two days after my exams. I just want to say that I am going to do my best in my exams and this is all that matters. I will get a good score, but the AoD &amp; Science is important to me. If my job has something to do with science, the AoD and disabilities, I will be happy.

Also, this is the first post I am dedicating a post to someone. This post is dedicated to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/hgtpsh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hgtpsh</a>Â (Joe Palmer). Lots of Love, &lt;3, Limo
