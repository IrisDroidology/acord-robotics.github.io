<h1 style="text-align: center;">George's Background</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first George book, George's secret key to the universe, follows the adentures of George Greenby, a British dude whoseparnts are extreme eco-activists. They want no part in modern technology, and it is later revealed (in George &amp; the blue moon) that he used to live in a primaive camp based off of the ice-age camps, with absolutely NO access to the outside world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the time, George's only friend was a pig, Freddy, who had been given to him by his grandmother, Mabel, for Christmas. George's father, Terrence, was not fond of Freddy, probably because of Freddy's "helping" in the garden.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But then he meets his new next-door neighbours, Eric Bellis, Annie Bellis, and Susan Bellis. Eric is a scientist who had a world-class super computer, Cosmos. Cosmos was a sentient computer who could even draw portals into space, allowing George, Eric &amp; Annie to go on HEAPS of space adventures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eventually George enters a science competition and wins a computer with his talk on science.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the second book, George's cosmic treasure hunt, the Bellises move away from Britain to America. Eric was able to go o the Global Space Agency and work on the Mars rover program, which was nicknamed HOMER in the novel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But Homer was playing up. Eventually they found one of Erics old enemies, and even older friend, and turned him back to the light side (and he was then able to help them in the next story and thus saved science - each of us is better than our worst act - we can get better).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tomorrow I will post part two of this series.</p>
