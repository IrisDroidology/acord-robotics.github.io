<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, we have our first team for the Droids Contest! Liam Russell, Ian Arbuckle &amp; myself are the team Liam'z Droidz &amp; Co. (::|LDC|AoD|::). We are planning to start building on my birthday (10th October), and are unveiling our progress at the 1st anniversary meeting, and finishing by next year (23rd December 2017).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are making a droid using the BB-8 Sphero (S.E.).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to Liam &amp; Ian for joining!</p>
