<p>On the Github repo IrisDroidology/Python-Learning, I started working on a Facebook Messenger bot today, and that got me thinking - how good would it be to use that for ACORD? Only problem was...ACORD's facebook page was in a state of disrepair...</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right now I'm in the middle of changing our name, creating a new group and populating our links and posts again. It will take a while but it will be worth it!</p>

<h2>Why do we need a Facebook page?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may be asking why we need a facebook page. Surely, you might ask, with SEO and our website and github organisation, we get enough views? Well, the answer is we don't. And facebook is one way to get more people to know about us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For good or for bad, everyone's on Facebook. With the Facebook Ads program and with millions of developers, artists, writers and more people on Facebook, it's an - until now - untapped reservoir of potential new recruits into ACORD. Job posting is also another cool feature that was recently added into Facebook pages. While most of our positions are volunteer based (stay as long as you want, but non-paid), we are still able to post these offers to Facebook. A lot of developers - especially new developers like myself - are interested in joining programs and companies, even as volunteers. The reason why most of our positions on offer are volunteer based is that our revenue is close to 0. By tapping into social media platforms like Facebook for volunteer developers, we can continue to work on our current projects while also making other apps and games. Just as important, is that if we start getting attention and traction (and a large part of that will be thanks to Facebook), we can monitize parts of our site with Google Ads, allowing us to make a small bit of money on the side. Right now, I don't know where these ads will be displayed (ideally, they'd not be displayed on the portal, but one of the downsides to moving everything to the portal is that that may be the only option). Whatever the case, logged in users will not see any ads on our platform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another benefit of Facebook is that it integrates nicely with all our current services (Reddit, Wordpress, Github), either directly or through services like Integromat. We can also create and connect groups to our Facebook page - while these will not replace the membership platform on our portal, they will serve as one of our services to get people involved with ACORD.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The more sites we're on, the more likely we are to be found by other people. While Nicholas &amp; I did create ACORD as a secret society, I feel that we can do more if people know about us. And who says that there aren't secret socities within ACORD????</p>

<h2>What will the Facebook page be able to do?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to serving as a way to expand our userbase and capitalize on the (currently cheap) Facebook Ads, our Facebook page also serves as one of the central documentation sites for us. The social wall feature allows us to post short (or long) status updates, that if we only used the portal for, would fill up this site with short posts - and they wouldn't be seen by as many people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Facebook is designed for users and pages to post status updates. Our portal is not. While our users can create status updates with our membership platform, the blog part of this site is not designed for that use. Facebook is - and for users who only use the portal, don't worry - all the status updates will be sent to a little widget in the portal, so you'll stay notified of what's going on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We can post events and meetups on the page and gauge a rough idea of how many people will come to our events, and there's a whole bunch more features that you can discover by going to our facebook page: </p>
