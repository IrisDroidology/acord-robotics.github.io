<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">CD App 101</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those that don't know what the App is for, please go to www.allianceofdroids.org.au/droidfolio/.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have decided to code - build - the app on Scratch.mit.edu for now. The link to the studio is:Â https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/3624091/. All the trials will be on this studio. You will be able to download them from our website and buy the full versions as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The problem is that the app won't look REALLY good, but we will work on that.</p>
