<p style="text-align: justify;">A solar eclipse happens when the moon goes directly in front of the sun (from our perspective). Transits are when a planet (from our perspective, again) blocks out a small (depends on the size of the planet and star) amount of sun/starlight from its parent star.</p>
There are only two planets between us and our sun (Mercury &amp; Venus), and because of their orbits transits of Mercury/Venus they are extremely rare. Let's take the Transit of Venus as an example - every 110 years, there is a transit, however 8 years after that there is another one, and then another 110 year wait, etc etc.

I missed the last transit of Venus (in 2012) (I made a pinhole camera) because it was too cloudy (which is typical Perth weather).

Today is the FULL solar eclipse, however you can't view it in Australia. I just wanted to say #HappyEclipseDay!!

Here's a cool image (I saw a PARTIAL solar eclipse in 2014 with my primary school "science club" and this sort of looks like it) that I found on the net.
