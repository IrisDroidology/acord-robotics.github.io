Breaking news: I (Limo Arbuckle) am writing the official constitution for the Alliance of Droids. Just a quick note, this has to be passed by both the CEO (me) and the Chairman (Nick).

We are following this guide on how to make a constitution:Â http://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Constitution

Outlining our rules concerning membership, social media, the site, and much more.

Expect it to be done by next week.

Limo
