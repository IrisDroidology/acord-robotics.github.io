<h1>Applying for a council grant</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Good news, everyone! I am planning to apply for a council grant for Sp~S6. If successful, we will be able to afford to hire a team of programmers, builders, and have enough money to build our droid. Professor Jane Burns is going to be meeting with me on the 26<sup>th</sup> of October, as you will probably know. I will be presenting a presentation to her over lunch, to explain about the project and why she should support us. You will be able to see if it was successful by then.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The council grant could be an enormous sum of money.</p>

<h1>Companion Robot Functions</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am planning that the council grant will go towards creating Sp~S6. Sp~S6 will be the first of the companion robots that I make. As you probably know, the Alliance of Droids was formed to help people with mental disabilities. The droids that we make will have special functions that make them an ideal companion droid.</p>

<h2>Hang Out Mode</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this mode the robot will be able to hang out with the owner, by playing board games, computer games, read books (mainly for younger kids), and more. It can hang out with you, and make you feel happy and loved.</p>

<h3>Note!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please note that these ideas are completely hypothetical and may not be used.</p>

<h1>Electronics</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to the R2-D2 Builder's Club, we are fortunate to have a lot of information about how to motorize our droid. One of the ideas is using MarcDuino's, which are a type of electronics that can turn on so-called 'holo-lights', play traditional R2-D2 Sounds, and more. Here is a list of parts that we will need for the MarcDuino's:</p>

<h2>M.D. Part List (1)</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Slave &amp; Master Board â€“ included in MarcDuino's V1.5 Kit from the R2-D2 Builders</li>
 	<li>Holo-lights â€“ Teeces</li>
 	<li>MP3 Trigger Soundboard</li>
 	<li>WiFly/xBee Receiver Radio</li>
 	<li>R2-Touch App â€“ DONE!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Drives â€“ Dome &amp; Feet</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The drives in the feet allow our droid to move. The drives in the dome basically allow the droid to move its head.</p>
