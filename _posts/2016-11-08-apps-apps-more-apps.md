<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, most apps these days need apps. And what better way to get people to download my app than to put it on our website blog? Hopefully people will see this. As of 9.30 AM (+8 GMT), we have had 4,100 views today. Anyway, what apps are we going to be making?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first app we have is from AppyPie, and has its pros and cons. Main thing is that it is filled with ads after 24 hours. But it has some unique features. The app is free for Apple &amp; Android, which is unique. But the ads obviously are very annoying.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using Adobe's PhoneGap App developer, I hope to make a good looking app - but the problem is that it is only for Android. I would have to pay to make an iOS app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In other news, I am also making a Facebook app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are a few functions that we would need:</p>

<ol>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Blog Feed</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Social Network</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Member Info</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Podcasts &amp; Documents</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Member List</li>
</ol>
