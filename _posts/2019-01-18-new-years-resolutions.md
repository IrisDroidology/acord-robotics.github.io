<h3>Happy new year!</h3>
Well, happy new year to all our droidlings! Great things will be happening in 2019, and we will be building more droids, improving more lives and creating more of Star Sailors than in 2018!

This post will be split into 2 parts. The first part is a review of what we did in 2018, and the second part is what we will do in 2019. Thanks and enjoy!
<h3>2018 in review</h3>
Wow - where to start? A0-D2 was officially started at the Artifactory last year. Using styrene as the base material, we used the computer program AutoCad to redesign the R2-D2 Builders Club plans and a laser cutter to cut out the styrene. It was a long journey to the first base plate, however once I learnt more about the platform I was able to get the plans finished faster.

A0-D2 had been in the making since 2016, when we had originally planned to redesign Sp-D2 into a motorised droid. However, we have since begun to explore other options, which will be explained in the second part of this post. We wouldn't have been able to create the plans and body of A0-D2 without the following people and organisations:
<ul>
 	<li>Autocad</li>
 	<li>InclusionWA (Including Joel Pearman &amp; Yoann Roy)</li>
 	<li>The CLPG (who we have since parted ways with)</li>
 	<li>The artifactory (especially Lemming and Fletcher)</li>
</ul>
In 2018, we also introduced the following additions to our network:
<ul>
 	<li>Youzer 2.0.6 (a skin for buddypress)</li>
 	<li>Toolbar customizer (ability to hide and show toolbar and activate plugins from frontend)</li>
 	<li>Thrive 3.0</li>
 	<li>Peepso (extra social network)</li>
</ul>
Personally, I was able to go through a phase of life this year that I will be talking about in a future post. I was also able to progress with our Youtube channel. Unfortunately the original Mushlantis corrupted, but we had some good times and some great base ideas. We started a new Mushlantis, where we built many different cities. Mushlantis 2.0, Mesaville and Ravineworld were all started this year, and we will continue to improve them all throughout 2019 and beyond.

We also started some new video series on youtube. The first of these is Starbound, a cross between Minecraft and terraria set in space. We have only uploaded one video so far, however we have more coming. We even have a special world for the AoD, which will be uploaded to the Games section of my Profile. We also purchased Master of Orion and Spore, so we will continue to make content for both the public and the AoD.

Now that we've got 2018 out of the way, let's go to 2019.
<h3>2019 &amp; beyond</h3>
First up, A0-D2. Currently we are needing to apply for a new grant as we need more parts and a new artifactory membership. After receiving $1500 from the CLPG, we expressed interest in a new grant, however they are unable to give the same project multiple grants. Currently, Yoann (InclusionWA) is enquiring with other grant providers while Iâ€™m on holiday.

We have finished the frame for A0-D2 however we need to get new glue for two reasons:
<ul>
 	<li>It accidentally spilled out (all of it)</li>
 	<li>The glue for some reason wasn't strong enough</li>
</ul>
So, therefore the logical first thing to do is to message Andrew or Grant about this. I have messaged Andrew, but not Grant. Hopefully we'll hear a reply soon.

A0-D2 is more than just a droid. He is a way for us to connect to the AoD network of droids. He's the huge efforts of all of us poured into a metal and styrene shell, with a side of electronics. Because of this, A0-D2 is staying riiiiight here. (Well, maybe not where he is now because that's at my current house). By this I mean that while we may get bought out as a company and/or a company might buy our idea (of course for such a deal to go ahead we will need to get credit for creating the original design and prototype), however the prototype is staying right with us in the AoD. And we're going to tinker on him, fix him, break him, and improve him just like we're improving every day.

My uncle, Ian, is working on a space in his house (yes it's a secret base) that will be able to house our droids, books, albums, items and backups. But first, let me just explain about all this.

<strong>Books</strong>

Star Sailors is just one of our books that we intend on writing. We intend to write non-fiction books, magazines and yearbooks. All of these (in physical form) will be archived in the base, as well as backups (based on slapband USB's &amp; R2-D2 Hard-drives) of the books and the site. Of course, while we intend to keep everything backed up on the portal and OneDrive, it is a symbolic gesture to keep the files in physical form, or at least in a semi-physical copy.

The USB's will be stored inside A0-D2 and our other droids, which will have fingerprint locks to open the compartment hatches (or maybe inserting a special CD will open it, and the CD itself will be in a locked box). We're also going to be storing other things...
<ul>
 	<li>Lightsabers (both ultrasabers and custom ones)...NID (not in droids)</li>
 	<li>Macbook Pro (with touchbar)??...NID</li>
 	<li>Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 (control panel for droids)</li>
 	<li>AoiPoD (control panel for droids)</li>
 	<li>AoiPhone (control panel for droids)</li>
 	<li>R2-D2 Sphero, Sideshow 6th Scale, Littlebits, and BB-8 Sphero (The littlebits will be one of our mini-droids)</li>
 	<li>Mini-droid (completely original design)</li>
 	<li>More to come...</li>
</ul>
Keep in mind this may take years.

<strong>Other stuff in 2019</strong>

In 2019 I will also be creating for myself a gaming PC (Steam: cyriosity_rov). This is partly because of my improved performance at Perth Modern in 2018. I will be building it hopefully with Fred &amp; Yoann.

Also in 2019, Fred and I will be releasing some music under the band name Chemical Mania.

In 2019, I hope to earn some money by completing jobs for websites and other freelancing opportunities.

Thank you so much for being part of the AoD in 2018, and we look forward to moving forward with all of us becoming droids in 2019.

If I die or am incapacitated before we achieve our goal, please make sure we achieve it. This is my chief purpose on this Earth and you all know how important this is to me. Thanks for sticking by me and make sure we get this job done.
