<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Palatino;">TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES...</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Palatino;">Unfortunately, for 5 days and 14 hours I was unable to edit my site because of an error in the wp-config.php file. For those that have been trying to get into the site frequently, I apologize a lot. Thankfully, Sean was able to rollback the site and the site is now fixed. Hopefully I will be able to go over the latest updates.Â </span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Palatino;">ABOUT THIS BLOG POST</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Palatino;">This blog post is going to be all about the stars - not just collisions, like we talked about last time. WeÂ <em>will</em> be talking about collisions, but only once - the galactic collision of Andromeda &amp; the Milky Way, our home galaxy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This post will feature a full reference list for theÂ <em>first</em> time (not including photos).</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Â LARGE (&amp; SMALL) STARS</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Large stars, well, are, large. But no-one can actually imagine just how big the stars are. Let's look at the Sun, an "average," middle-aged star. It has a diameter of 1.4 MILLION kilometers, and has a core temperature of 15 million degrees Celsius, with a "surface" temperature of 6,000 degrees Celsius. Note that the surface temperature means the temperature of the gas that is on the edge of the star.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see, the temperature of stars in the core is so much higher than the temperature of the "surface." But does the temperature change depending on the star?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To be classified as a star - which basically means it burns elements to create heavier elements in its core - a star has to have a temperature in the core of at least 5 million degrees Celsius, or else hydrogen will not fuse. Therefore the mass of a star can be no less than 7% of the Sun's mass.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few stars that are just above this at around 7.4% Â of the sun's mass, and have thereforeÂ been around for a huge amount of time, longer than the 4.6 billion years the sun has been around for. You may think that the more gas (and therefore the more mass) the star has, it would live for longer, but in actuality stars with a larger mass have a much shorter life span.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So the largest stars may only live for a few million years!</p>
