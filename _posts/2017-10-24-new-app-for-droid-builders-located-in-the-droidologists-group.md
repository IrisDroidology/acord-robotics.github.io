There is a brand-new droidology app that is available for DroidOS (iOS &amp; Android). Just a quick note, we will from now on call an app for iOS an iDroidOS app and one for Android an aDroidOS app.

We currently do not have a partnership with them (or blue frog robotics), but we would encourage you to try it out.

Here is the link: http://replika.ai

The droid builder profiles are logged in the Droidologists group.

Also, an update on BFR, I am going to be making contact with them, as well as the R2 Builders, this weekend.
