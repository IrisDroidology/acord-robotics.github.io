<p style="text-align: justify;">Heyllo everyone! My name is Limo, and in today's Blog Changes post we are going to be talking about more proposed features that we will/may be adding to our website. Chief of these is, of course, the membership plans, as well as some bug fixes, post improvements, and more.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Â Part 1 - Premium Members</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A feature I have been thinking about adding is some different plans for when you sign up. Like YouTube Red - which gives you ad-blocking YT features - you do not have to purchase most purchasable posts, pages, etc. What this means is that you can save your hard-earned credits for incredibly awesome stuff. However, because anyone can sign up for a premium membership, we have to make sure that you guys can't get Droid Builder-only stuff, so your special member base will be located (hopefully) at http://premium.allianceofdroids.org.au. You can send me a PM or an email to sign up for a premium membership, which rules out spam bots (which could potentially get me into trouble with fraud and malware as well).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to add different plans, like no ads, premium content, premium support, better droid-building tutorials, and even more. Buying credits with real money allows you to get access to the no-ads part of the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, all this is not confirmed but will hopefully be added soon.</p>
