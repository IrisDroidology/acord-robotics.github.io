<p>For about 2 years now, the Portal has moved away from being a personal site for our users to being one more business-oriented. We moved a lot of our posts to Jekyll sites, which was a well-intentioned experiment that turned out to be a disaster. The Portal suffered as a result, but now, once again, we'll be sharing every post on the Portal.</p>

<p>I have my own personal site, larbuckle.tech, which I use not only as an online resume, but as a personal blog. Before we switched the aim and focus of this portal, I would post my blog posts here instead. That will be happening again. </p>

<p>We will also be aiming to release more news updates about ACORD itself, including the status of our projects like Star Sailors &amp; Stellarios, as well as events like Artifactory meet-ups. </p>

<p>I hope you enjoy this revamp of the Portal blog. It's been a while in the making, and I hope that with the import of more talent and new members, the Portal will become a richer place.</p>
