<h1 style="text-align: justify;">THE ALLIANCE OF DROIDS</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Alliance of Droids is a charity dedicated to helping kids &amp; adults with mental disabilities. We make things like models, robots, and more for them, free of charge. We aim to raise awareness for people with Autism, AD/HD, ADD, and more. We believe that everyone is human and should have equal chances. By creating things for the kids &amp; adults, we show them &amp; others that we support them and raise awareness at the same time.</p>


<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Formation</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">We were formed on the 23rd of December in 2015. The co-founders were myself (LIAM ARBUCKLE), &amp; Nicholas Antipas. We now have a dedicated member base and are proud to say we are still going strong.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Members</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">We have about 15 members at the moment, with more members signing up monthly. You can also sign up on this website, although you do have to go through the selection process first.Â </span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Becoming a member</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Probably the easiest way to become a member is to sign up on this website, although there are a few other ways. Meeting one of the members in person or online is also a good idea, and is good because you can see what other members say about us, not just members that update this website.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">How we give back</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">We give back to our members in a large amount of ways, and we call them MEMBER PERKS. These benefits can give you access to exclusive items, and there is little charge for them. We charge nothing for the cheapest member perks, while for the things like badges, your sash, and business cards, we charge a small but acceptable fee.Â </span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Member Perks</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mainly member perks are things like access to different conferences, meetings &amp; ranks. We also give out badges and pins that you can attach to your sash. This allows you to show who you are and your prestige.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">In the category MEMBER PERKS, you will be able to see all our benefits of being a member, both free and paid.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Sponsors</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Our first major sponsor wasÂ <a href="http://www.mindbuzz.com.au" target="_blank">SEAN FIRTH</a>, who sponsors us for this website. At the moment we are currently switching this site to www.allianceofdroids.org.au, but www.allianceofdroids.com was our free domain. After this site is transferred, we will be able to make this our site for buying your badges &amp; other perks.</span></p>
