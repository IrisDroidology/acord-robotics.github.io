According to a kid at my school (A.B.M.), I can't get into trouble because I have aÂ <em>mental illness</em>. In actuality, Autism is not a mental illness, it is a disorder. This doesn't mean that I have a get out of jail free card - how many people with mental illnesses are in jail?

The media also very unfairly portrays us as people with severe disorders - so we either can't speak, read or write, or we are always going around beating people up. I remember once a few years back the media reported that a person with Autism beat up another teen, when it was the other way around. People at my school made me afraid of "coming out" because of the public opinion.

So ABM is completely wrong and is a gigantic bully.
