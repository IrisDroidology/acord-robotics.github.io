<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Introduction</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Â <span style="color: #ff0000;">I love Mars Rovers! Mars Rovers are basically a cross-between cars and space probes that trundle along on the surface of the Red Planet. Most of them are owned by the European Space Agency (ESA) or the National Aeronautics &amp; Space Admin (NASA, American Space Agency), however many companies and nations worldwide contribute to the creation and design of these beauties.</span></p>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">In this post I will be talking about Mars Rovers, why the AoD should be interested in them, if we could possibly build them and help NASA/ESA/SpaceX/other Space Agencies.</span>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">NEWSFLASH!!</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">We have been hitting a huge amount of views on our Twitter &amp; Facebook pages and I just wanted to say thanks for all the followers of both pages. They add public news as well as small tidbits of private info (remember, the REAL stuff is hidden in this portal).</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">The First Martian Probes</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">Mars is a really hard planet (/heavenly body) for us to land probes on. Over two-thirds of missions to Mars (even orbiting missions) have failed, sometimes burning up, crashing (Beagle 2), or getting stuck in Earth Orbit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">But out of the one-third of missions to Mars that have been successful, we have learnt a lot about Mars, its moons and the possibilities for Martian Life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">Beagle 2 was a Martian space probe designed by the European Space Agency and crash-landed on Mars in 2003. Recently, Martian satellites (man-made, not the natural ones) photographed what appears to be Beagle 2 - well, what's left of it. The photos were taken in the same place that most experts expected it to have crash-landed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">Beagle 2 was designed to search for Martian life and was therefore important to the field of astrobiology (and also the AoD).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">The Viking probes were stationary robots that were the first probes to look for traces of life in the Martian soil. Both probes found what could've been traces of life, however most experts (including me) believe that most traces of life may be underneath the soil depth of what Viking 1 &amp; Viking 2 was able to test (the biological components in the top layers of the soil would've (MOSTLY) been destroyed by radiation).</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">Curiosity &amp; the Mars 2020 Rover</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">Curiosity landed on Mars in August 2012 and is one of the most successful Mars rovers to date (Opportunity &amp; Spirit were others). It is about a tonne and looks really cute. One of its primary objectives was to look for traces of life in the Martian soil, atmosphere and caves/mountains.</span></p>
<span style="color: #00ffff;">The Mars 2020 rover is a rover (also designed by NASA) that will (hopefully) be launched in 2020 to look for more detailed traces of life on the Red Planet.</span>
