Hey everyone. Today I am going to be going over our next droid and our news update.

Professor Jane Burns has recently organised to meet with me on the 26th of October. She is interested in my droid ideas and may be able to sponsor us for our droid.

The project management page which shows our to-do list, files, discussion and more. I would encourage all members who are interested in droids to check it out.

The page will also include the amount of funding secured and money that we still need to aquire.

Meeting with Professor Jane Burns will allow us to share our story with people who are able to help raise awareness about our cause and we will have more funding, members, and droids.

I have also been contacted by MJHenks from the R2-D2 Builders Club, and the CS:R Senna Frame (body) is about $405, including shipping. Hopefully we can secure the funding by then. I have asked him to wait until the 26th of October so we can (hopefully) secure the required funding.

The Senna frame will not be necessary unless we want to give Sp-D2-&gt;Sp~S6 a new body.
