I'm going to get right into this post, which is about badges and pins that all members can earn and how to earn them.
<h1>Years of Service</h1>
For every year that you are a member of the Alliance, you get a different coloured badge. We plan to have just a number with a different colour as the background. These are usually given out at AoD anniversaries or the date that you joined the Alliance.
<ul>
 	<li>1 year: Black</li>
 	<li>2 years: Purple</li>
 	<li>3 years: Blue (Dark)</li>
 	<li>4 years: Blue (Light)</li>
 	<li>5 years: Green (Light)</li>
 	<li>6 years: Yellow</li>
 	<li>7 years: Orange</li>
 	<li>8 years: Red</li>
 	<li>9 years: White</li>
 	<li>10 years-19 years: corresponding colour with black rim</li>
 	<li>20 years-29 years: corresponding colour with red rim</li>
</ul>
Note: If you last 10 years you'll get a special surprise!
<h2>Anniversary Badges</h2>
Similar to years of service, these badges commemorate activities that you have done to celebrate AoD-Day, and once we have the conferences we've always wanted we will be giving those badges out on the night.
<h1>Department Badges</h1>
For each department you join, you will get a badge - either your department's logo or the initials of your department. Here's how it works:
<ul>
 	<li>Join the department: Department</li>
 	<li>6 months of service (to department): Sergeant</li>
 	<li>1 Droid Built: Lieutenant + Droid Builder</li>
 	<li>2 Droids Built (Virtual &amp; Physical): Captain + Droid Builder</li>
 	<li>1 major droid/3 droids (at least 1 virtual/physical): Specialist + Droid Builder</li>
 	<li>Department leader: Department Leader (needs to have be at least Sergeant &amp; Lieutenant)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Star Sailors Badges</h1>
These badges will be awarded for achievements earned in the game.
<h1>The Sash</h1>
The sash is where you will eventually put your badges, with different sections for Star Sailors Badges, Department Badges, &amp; YOS/Anniversary Badges.
