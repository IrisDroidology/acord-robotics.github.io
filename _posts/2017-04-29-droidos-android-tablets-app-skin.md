<p style="text-align: justify;">A few of you may know that I got my first tablet, an Android Samsung Tab S2 for my birthday last year. This tablet is used for AoD purposes, including recording videos, gaming awareness (basically just gaming), blogging, and droid designing. But not many of you will know that we have our own app and some extra cool skinning customization features for Android devices. We also have an app for iPhones, iPod Touches, and Android phones, which you can get to by going onto the website and adding it to the homescreen (which makes it a standalone app) - sorry, no iPad! But you can also have a remote access app to go to an android device from another device to get to the app!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few things you need to do to get the app, including downloading some third-party apps from the app store. Firstly, download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fb.iwidget&amp;hl=en">Snap Swipe Drawer</a> &amp; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urysoft.folder&amp;hl=en">Foldery</a>. Add your favourite apps to the Foldery widget, including the Droidology app <a href="http://app.appsgeyser.com/4783438/Droidology">here</a>. Then connect the Foldery widget to the Snap Swipe Drawer. If you want protection from the widget, hide the apps (in the foldery widget) with a launcher (more on this later), and then download an app locker. Finally, add any other widgets you want to the SS drawer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, installing a launcher. Launchers make android so customizable and exist because android is open source. This launcher, Nova Launcher Prime, is what the AoD use and all members can go to a link on my <a href="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/members/droidology">profile</a> wall that has the nulled version of NLP. It is completely safe and the droids swear on it!</p>
