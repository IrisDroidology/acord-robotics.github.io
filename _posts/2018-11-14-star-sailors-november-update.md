Hello everyone, and welcome to a brand new post on the portal. Today I'm going to be talking about features that will be coming to Star Sailors over the next few months.
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Planets</h1>
Seriously, who wouldn't want a planet for themselves? In Star Sailors, not only can you explore different planets, but you can even colonize them yourself. We have plans for a large galaxy map at http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/hyperspace/ - which is where you go to when you want to jump in your ship to go to hyperspace. Of course, you will need a ship to go into hyperspace first.

Since we are primarily using wordpress pages for different planets and ships and locations, we are currently stumped for how to make sure that you can access hyperspace at certain times. Currently, this is our best option:
<ul>
 	<li>Have a page for everyone's ships where they can go to access hyperspace, maybe having a map of breadcrumbs to get back to your ship from wherever you are</li>
</ul>
Eventually, you will be able to colonize your own planet, launch space stations and interact with the flora and fauna there! Each planet will have a different surface and composition, however using the Matter Transformer (we will try and find a better name for this one!!) you can change everything about your planet and then everything around it. To buy the matter transformer you will have to pay 500 credits. You can buy it in the hyperspace store - http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/hyperspace/store/. Currently this page is a work-in-progress.
<h1>Vaults</h1>
Vaults are where you will be able to store videos, photos and other notes, and it will be located on the planet where your base is (for example allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/my-planet/my-vault/). Vaults are free to set up and we will be releasing a video tutorial on how to do so. This will be in a future post.

We recommend that you also upload all your files to your member galleries. This is currently also a WIP but we will notify all users when it is given the greenlight.

&nbsp;
<h1>Hyperspace</h1>
Hyperspace is the best way to get around the universe. You buy a ship (http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/ship-hub/ and some fuel (http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/general-store/) and then you're away. The fuel never needs to be replaced.

There are many more planned features for Star Sailors. If you want to get involved in the development, go to http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/ss-affliates/ or email us at droidology@allianceofdroids.org.au with the Subject Title "Star Sailors - AoD Droidling."
