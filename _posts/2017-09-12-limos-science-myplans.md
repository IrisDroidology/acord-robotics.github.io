Just received my science test results, and I did alright. I did my best, however I have a few new plans to get even better and become an even better scientist.

Here is my plan:
<ol>
	<li>Start Human Bio</li>
	<li>Log-in to KhanAcademy.org &amp; start Human Bio research</li>
	<li>Log-in to EducationPerfect.com &amp; start Human Bio Research</li>
	<li>Take notes on paper &amp; OneNote</li>
	<li>Complete worksheets</li>
	<li>Read books</li>
	<li>Ace the tests</li>
</ol>
I just want to do the best I possibly can.
