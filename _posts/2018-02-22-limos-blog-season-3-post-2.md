This year, we finally have enough players to play in a carnival with the AFL Women's and the AFL 9's. It is really exciting and I can't wait to play.

Back row: Uncle Jezza (Jamie), John (Ruckman), Uani (Midfielder), Josh (Defender), Carlene (Coach)

Front row: Mitch (Coach), Matt (Coach), Geoff (Midfielder, Captain), Limo (Forward, Leadership group), Tyler (Vice-captain, midfielder)

Note - there are more players that aren't in this photo:
<ul>

	<li>More to come</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">SCHOOL SECTION</h3>
I got an "A" in my latest science test - 75% - which was on genetics and DNA replication. I am really proud of my efforts and it is even sweeter knowing I did heaps of study, homework and research.
