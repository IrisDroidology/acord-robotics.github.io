Today I'm going to be talking about becoming a droid. This is something that I've never told anyone except Matt (from inclusionwa.org.au). This post is going to be talking about what a droid is to me, why I created the AoD and also some other stuff, like the droid updates. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>What is a droid?</h1>
<p>A droid is a robot that is semi-sentient - that is, can replicate the "human" process of thinking. It can learn from mistakes and can do things outside its programming. A true droid would be R2-D2, but you could also say that the Mars Rovers, especially the Curiosity rover (and the upcoming MarsOne rovers) would be "droids" too. Curiosity is anywhere from 7-23 light-minutes away from earth (light travels 300,000 km/s, so Mars is quite a long way away!). That means that it would take at least 7 minutes to send a message to Curiosity, and at least 7 minutes to get confirmation that the Curiosity rover had received the command and was doing it! Curiosity is operated by humans, but also has to figure things out for itself - to some capacity.</p>
<p>For us in the AoD (or the Corporation of Robots - our new name if we are forced to change it by Disney), a droid can be something else. A large part of the AoD is role-playing - that's why I call us droidlings. You've all helped make my life better by joining in something that I'm proud of, and helping me with it - you're a true droid. But even if you hadn't of joined the AoD, you'd still be a droid. You have done other good things. Josh has done work for MarsOne, trying to get himself and 3 others to Mars. Matt's helped me with my web design skills and played an important part in helping me develop socially.</p>
<p>And there are others that aren't part of the AoD. My dog (technically an honorary member) has helped me in so many ways - mindfullness when walking, happiness whenever I'm with her. My science teachers this year have helped me progress in science, getting to an average of 70% in the year above (for reference, I'm doing Year 11 in Year 10) in tests and assessments.</p>
<p>And then there is the bottom of the barrel. Mass murderers. Terrorists. Arsonists. Even some - or all - of these people that society regards as filth are droids. Just doing one thing that makes someone's life better makes you a droid - whether it's holding the door open for someone, or helping them when they're in need of help. I'm not saying that these people do not deserve punishment. They do, but they are droids. For example, there was a man that was sentenced to death for the murder of a police officer in the US. His last meal request was a vegetarian pizza (presumably to cater to everyone's cultural preferences) to be delivered to a homeless person. It wasn't allowed, but it inspired people to do what he wanted to do. He gave 1000 people a meal for the night.</p>
<p>That is why I don't believe in the death penalty. Not even for the most horrific crimes. Rehabilitation and prison can work wonders. Look at the Bali 9 ringleaders, and what they did in their last years of life while on death row. People can change and this is why everyone has the capacity to be a droid.</p>
<p>I dislike my bullies strongly. But they have all done things for me - made me stronger, occasionally intentionally helped me. They are droids, but not my friends. But I respect them for the small stuff. It may be a Buddhist-type belief, but this is me and this is what the AoD believes in.</p>[/et_pb_text][et_pb_blog posts_number="4" include_categories="102,5,97,184" show_author="off" show_date="off" show_categories="off" _builder_version="3.0.51" fullwidth="off"][/et_pb_blog][et_pb_text _builder_version="3.0.51"]<h1>The Droid Update</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As of my 16th birthday - 10/10/18 - we glued the frame of A0-D2 together. We still need to add some extra glue every week to make it as strong as possible, but technically the frame is finished.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Frame - done</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Skins</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Legs - next on our to-do list</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Electronics</li>
</ul>
<p>We've printed off the first parts of the legs and will hopefully start gluing them together next Wednesday.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Last year I received a Littlebits.com R2-D2 for my 15th birthday (I actually bought it with Mum 2 or 3 days before and knew what was coming, but it didn't make it any less sweet). Yoann (InclusionWA) and I bought some paints and started painting it last week at the Artifactory.org.au. We bought some plastic primer (spray) and some cream paint (spray) from Bunnings.com.au (to give the droid a weathered look like in the Star Wars movies), and got some gold, red and white model paints for the detailing. The primer and the cream spray paint was applied last week and the droid was stored in my new Artifactory locker. Today we started applying the modeling paint.</p>

<p>Come back next time (hopefully Saturday or Sunday) where I talk about where I want to go in life, footy, and the Star Sailors Universe. I hope to see you then in the next post about who I am and what I want to be.</p>
