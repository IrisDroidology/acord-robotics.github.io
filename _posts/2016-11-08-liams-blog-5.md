<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I'm BACK!</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Well, I am back after not having posted for a while, with my fifth post in the blog. On Sunday I went to the WA R2-D2 Builders Club workshop, which was about half an hour away from where I live. It was an amazing experience, and I would like to thank Andrew &amp; Grant for letting me be a part of it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Today I will be giving a review of The Martian (the book &amp; the movie), some articles that I have found, and some other cool things, including a full build log of yesterday's work (which you can also see here:Â [button size="default" url="www.allianceofdroids.com/droidfolio" open_new_tab="true" text="Droidfolio" icon="" type="default" bottom_margin=""])</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Articles</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As always, my blogs would not be complete without some awesome articles. I have revisited the siteÂ [button size="default" url="www.space.com" open_new_tab="true" text="Space.com" icon="" type="default" bottom_margin=""] which I last visited last year. Here is the first article, and as always, the references will be on the article review and in the bibliography section.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[button size="large" url="http://www.space.com/34629-nasa-fema-asteroid-impact-test.html" open_new_tab="true" text="Asteroid Attack|How would we deal with it?" icon="" type="shadow" bottom_margin=""]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This article, from the site I mentioned earlier, is talking about how NASA (National Aeronautics &amp; Space Administration) &amp; the ESA (European Space Agency) would deal with a threat like an asteroid. Before we get into the article, I would just like to mention a few things that you should know before you read my article blog:</p>

<ol>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Meteorites are different to asteroids - asteroids are generally large rocks, and meteorites can be the crumbled-off bits of a comet or asteroid.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">The Earth experiences, on average, at least one major impact from an asteroid every 100 million years - the last one was 65 million years ago (dinosaurs).</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">The only recorded case of a space rock killing somethingÂ <em>on Earth</em>Â was a dog in Egypt about a century ago.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">There are a few (untested) methods of removing the threat of an asteroid impact - but this would require us to collaborate between countries and spend lots of money (most of the people in the government don't want to do either).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">59 years ago, the first man-made object (Sputnik 1) blasted off into space (satellite). Now, many Earthlings have seen the Earth from space, and there will be many more in the future. In those 59 years, space flight and space travel has changed a lot. And I mean a lot. It is reported that a modern calculator would have more computing power than all the computers used to put man on the moon in 1969...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If modern calculators are so powerful, than scientific equipment is incredibly powerful, right?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From a certain perspective, yes. But we still have a long way to go. We still can't travel interstellar, we don't know much about exoplanets - we have only discovered 2000 of the LARGEST planets, because our telescopes</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a) Can't pick up planets much smaller</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b) Can't see planets in certain orbits</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which means that we only see a tiny, tiny fraction of the planets in our galaxy - or even our VERY local neighborhood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All those years ago, we wouldn't have been able to discover a threat like an asteroid and stop it from destroying us. Now, we can. It (as I said above) would require a huge amount of co-operation &amp; funds, but weÂ <em>couldÂ </em>do it. Obviously, the closer an asteroid gets to us, the harder (and more expensive) it would be to contain the threat. So that is why NASA &amp; the ESA have teams of scientists looking for potentially dangerous asteroids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the methods we can use is to strap a rocket to it, therefore nudging it off course. Or we could explode a bomb next to it. But other than those methods, we just can't afford - or do - other methods - yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another thing to keep in mind isÂ <em>keyholes</em>. These are basically different areas in space. If we knock an asteroid away from Earth, it will go through a keyhole. Providing it doesn't get eaten up by a gas giant, or crash into the Sun, it will come back because of its orbit. Every keyhole is different - knocking it through hole a would mean it could come back in 2 years, while hole b would come back in 200 years.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">I found this article from the official NASA website today. For those that don't know, the Curiosity Rover landed on Mars in August 2012, four years ago. Its main objective is to search for life on Mars. It is still in good condition.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">This rock was probably from an iron-nickel meteorite that fell from the Red Planet's sky. These typically come from asteroids that melt.Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">The scanner on board Curiosity picked up iron, nickel, phosphorous and some other compounds in the element. As far as I know, iron and phosphorous are building blocks for Life as we know it. These other elements/compounds include oxygen and organic materials.</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Book &amp; Movie Reviews</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>By Liam Arbuckle...</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Â The Martian was one of the most awaited movies of 2015. But there are plenty of people who dislike it for various reasons. The book was also a success, but the book was more adulty than the movie. Today I am going to be reviewing both the book and the movie.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, we have the book. One of my English teachers last year bought me the book when she was showing me a trailer for a movie and the Martian ad popped up. It is one of my most-read books, in fact after only three months it was tatty and torn - which is sort of okay since I liked it so much. I read it on average twice a month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, the book included a lot of swearing and adult language, but I believe that combined with the personalities of the characters it worked our alright. The author included many different personalities and people to make an interesting story line with many twists and turns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The book made it really easy for me to imagine what was going on, but a lot of books sort of need you to watch the movie to see it in your head - and those books hardly ever get made into movies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All in all, the book was a success - combined with the cooperation of many countries, it was great - I just wish that the governments today would do the same!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The movie included a lot less swearing, probably because the movie, while rated M for mature audiences, would be seen by kids as young as 7. I have seen movies that are MA 15+ in the cinema that have 8 year olds there. In my opinion, parents today are incredibly ignorant, especially if they are young and in their twenties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The movie put everything into place that I couldn't find in the book - so it was a success.</p>
