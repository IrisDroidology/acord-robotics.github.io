<p>I've created my own personal website using Tumblr and the Sugar theme, which is a custom theme that I have edited for my use. The reason I decided to create a personal site was because I am planning to start teaching on Udemy, which is a website that has literally thousands of courses on hundreds of different topics. I'll be teaching web design and portfolio creation, and as of right now I am not able to create another Wordpress website (and Bootstrap is driving me crazy!). I've decided to use Tumblr for the time being. While Tumblr lacks many features, it is a great social network and the theme looks great. </p>

<p>I may create a Wordpress site later on (or Jekyll), but right now this will do.</p>
