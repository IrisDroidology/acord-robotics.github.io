<h1>Last Time</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last time in this series, I gave a brief overview of my life as a disabled person. I introduced myself in a way so that you would (hopefully) be encouraged to read more of this series.</p>

<h1>This Time</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this post, I am going to be talking about how I react to bullying for the first time. I am also going to be talking about why I get bullied and what I do about it.</p>

<h1>Primary School Bullying</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have pretty much been bullied since I was starting primary school. The first time I was bullied, it was because of my passion of science. I didn't realise it at the time, but it seems that most kids in this age find math and science <em>incredibly</em> boring. I was the odd one out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was bullied because of rumours that were spread about me, and because of the way I acted. That last one was a biggie, because most of you probably know that I am autistic. It made my life incredibly hard to bear, and starting in year 5 I attempted committing suicide. If you understood how I was feeling at the time, you would understand my actions.</p>

<h2>Bullying â€“ Because of Autism</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I acted very differently to most other kids in my school. For example, I hated, absolutely hated, participating in those annoying games of Cowboys &amp; Indians, and I also rarely interacted with kids who weren't my friends when I was younger. This, obviously, made people realise I was different. The way I acted must have shown them that I was more vulnerable to bullying than most others, and as such I was picked out as a special target. This just evolved when I became older, but I now see that there was nothing I could do about it. I wasn't even diagnosed yet, and there was no phycologist that I could go to.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also had a different way of speaking than most people. Because of this, I went to a Speech Therapy clinic from the time I was about 3 to when I finished my second year of primary school. I had certain words that I could not, absolutely not say. This did not make the conversation harder with me, on the contrary, I loved talking â€“ but I couldn't talk about a large variety of topics. I couldn't talk about how I felt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After I was diagnosed, my parents organised a meeting with the teachers at my school. In about the third term, a man came into my school to explain to my class about my disorder. I guess I had the same sort of feeling that many gay men and women experience when they 'come out of the closet' â€“ my secret was no longer hidden, and everyone knew about it, for the better or for the worst.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I do not believe that these kids were ignorant. Most of the kids called me names, like "Arseburger (Asperger's)". But even worse was when the kids were just looking out the window, talking among themselves â€“ this was worse because it showed that they weren't paying attention. While neither of those two groups cared, the first group was probably better because they actually payed attention. I believe that since they were quite young, they didn't really understand the full implications of their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would get fired up pretty easily, and this also made me a target for the bullies. I would often retort with what I call an Illusional Bully Response â€“ basically I would seem like a bully, but I would just be retaliating. Retaliating, for me, is not the same as bullying â€“ while you shouldn't take the bait, you didn't start it and most of the time you aren't trying to hurt them â€“ just show them that you can stand up for yourself and that you're not weak.</p>

<h2>Rumours about me</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was bullied more verbally and mentally than physically, but even that was hard to deal with. There is really no proof of verbal bullying except your word if the only witnesses are bullies or are afraid to say something â€“ but with physical bullying at least someone can see the damage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I was in primary school I had a few crushes. As most kids at that age do, rumours were spread about me and the bullies saw this as another thing to bully me about. The first rumour that was spread about me was created by my sister in Year 2.</p>

<h2>How I coped</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Until Year 5, I didn't have a councillor or a doctor that I could go to. I would often complain to my parents, but most of the time they were powerless. Add the fact that my parents wanted to get me diagnosed, they didn't have a lot of time on their hands. When I first saw a councillor, I had to figure out if that was the person I could pour out my heart to. My previous phycologist, Dr. Aaron Voon, was that person, before he was arrested for child pornography charges. I never minded if the councillor was of the opposite sex or not, but I found it easier to relate to a guy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from those two methods, I would either keep a diary or keep it to myself. Eventually I got used to it.</p>

<h1>High School</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was bullied much worse in high school than in primary school, but I guess that is because people were more confident in their abilities to hurt. Since it was an academically selective school, most people figured they could act how they wanted to and were smarter than the rest. Although we had to do a test to get in, it wasn't about how smart you were â€“ it was about the way you think and if you could fit in with the schools that offered places. Plenty of smart people didn't get in. Even the teachers were bullies sometimes â€“ they must have figured that we could cope with it, since we were about 12 at the time. They liked to make fun of a student and then bask in the silent laughter of the class bullies.</p>

<h2>Coming out â€“ 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I started high school, I 'came out' again. This gave birth to more bullying about my disability, and it made it worse than ever before, because they knew more ways to hurt. Even some of the teachers poked fun at me because I was different.</p>

<h1>Next timeâ€¦</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the next post, I will hopefully be posting about my relationships with my family. See you then!</p>
