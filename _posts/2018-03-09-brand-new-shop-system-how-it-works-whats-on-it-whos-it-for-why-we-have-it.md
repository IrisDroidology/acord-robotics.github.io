Located at http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/products/, our brand new shop system has the following categories of products:
<ul>
 	<li>CEO's (that's me!!) fan products (merch, subscriptions, patreon)</li>
 	<li>AOD Premium membership</li>
 	<li>Droid Books (galleries, etc.)</li>
 	<li>DroidOS apps - if from app stores, cheaper than retail price, if our apps, they're exclusive to AoD droidlings.</li>
 	<li>Gaming Server whitelists - please remember that you don't have to pay to be a part of us, and we aren't trying to get your money. These things just cost money to run!</li>
</ul>
Remember that you get credits for purchasing these products, and you can also spend your credits on these products!
