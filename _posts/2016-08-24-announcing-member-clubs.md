<h2 style="text-align: justify;">What are member clubs?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Member clubs will be like departments, but as it will be a different branch every single group of club will be lead by a single person, basically the leader of the departments. The rules will be laid out by the leaders of the groups instead of by the Droids Council, but the D.C. will still be able to intervene if we believe that there are things that can be changed in the different clubs/groups.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">What member clubs?</h2>
<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Kennel Club - Basically a club researching the positive impact of pets on troubled people</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Conference Club - This club organizes where all the conferences, parties and meetings will be</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Positive Relationships Club - This club researches the impact and benefits of positive relationships on troubled people</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Funding &amp; Sponsors Club - All major sponsors are in this club, as well as the people who want to be in the main parts of our fundraising. Members who participate in fundraisers are temporary members of this club.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Groups?</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>1&amp;3</li>
 	<li>2&amp;4</li>
</ul>
<h2>Member Perks?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Members of the different clubs will get member perks decided on by the group leaders, but as they are all department members as well, they get the member perks I have talked about already.</p>
