<p>Before 2017, the Willetton Football Club only had 4 teams &ndash; Seniors, Reserves, Cults and Seconds. In 2017, their fifth team came along &ndash; the Integrated team &ndash; and we played our first league match (against Coolbinia) in 2018, after training for a year. Football has been a big part of my life since high school, when I started going to regular matches.</p>
<p>In 2017, we had about 6 players, which wasn&rsquo;t enough to be able to play in the league. However, we played 3 scratch matches &ndash; one against Fremantle CBC (Green) at home, one against High Wycombe (during a WAFL match) and the best of us &ndash; the leadership group &ndash; played at Domain Stadium in the traditional curtain raiser before the West Coast-Carlton game in the AFL.</p>
<p>The first match we ever played as a team was a true thriller. I got my first goal, and the team&rsquo;s first official goal assist. I kicked 2 and had 4 assists, and we won after the siren when our skipper, Geoff, marked the ball I&rsquo;d cleared out of the ruck contest. We played against High Wycombe, and I kicked 3. I had 3 disposals in the match at Domain Stadium, which was my worst tally &ndash; then or ever (I did spend 1.5 quarters on the bench), but those 3 disposals were able to get us inside 50. We lost a close one by 4 points.</p>
<p>Fast forward to this year, and I played 14 matches &ndash; 12 league, 1 state (at the new Optus Stadium) and a scratch match against Wembley. I kicked 4 against Wembley, had 2 goal assists in the state game and kicked 14 goals in the league, which was top 5.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the league breakdown</p>
<ol>
<li>First ever league game &ndash; vs Coolbinia (Away) (Loss)
<ol>
<li>2 assists</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>First home game &ndash; vs Fremantle CBC (Gold) (Home) (Loss)
<ol>
<li>1 assist</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>High Wycombe (Away) (Loss)
<ol>
<li>First league goal &ndash; 10 meters out, 60-degree angle from a free kick in the second quarter</li>
<li>2 assists</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>First league win &ndash; Warnbro (Home) (Win)
<ol>
<li>2 goals</li>
<li>2 assists</li>
<li>Score &ndash; 10.6.66 to 5.3.33</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>First game as captain (did the toss, captain for a game) &ndash; Mental Health Game &ndash; CBC Green (Away)
<ol>
<li>3 assists</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>North Beach (Away) (Win)
<ol>
<li>6 behinds</li>
<li>4 assists</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Kingsway (Home) (Loss)
<ol>
<li>2 goals</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Wembley (Home) (Win)
<ol>
<li>6 goals
<ol>
<li>First one was a dribbler from the right behind post in the first quarter in a scrum of 12 players. Looked like it was going to dribble straight and then bounced through at right angles for a goal</li>
<li>Second one (also in the first quarter) &ndash; snap shot from 7 meters from the right boundary, bent over while kicking it to see if it went in and slipped as I kicked</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Third one (Third quarter) &ndash; equalled club record for most goals in a game (previous was Geoff against Coolbinia)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Fourth one &ndash; Club record for most goals in a game, I was being tackled 30 meters from the goal, handpassed to Garry (#17), he handpassed back to my face and I drilled a drop punt from 15 meters out on a 45 degree angle to the left of the goals</li>
<li>Fifth one &ndash; (also the third quarter)</li>
<li>Sixth one &ndash; I&rsquo;d been told I was playing in defence for the last quarter WITH license to push forward. I kicked a snap from the boundary line &ndash; 5 meters from the behind post and it went in. Afterwards I kicked a point that went in off the post</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>4 assists</li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
<li>Fremantle CBC Gold (Away) (Loss)
<ol>
<li>1 assist</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>High Wycombe (Away) (Loss)
<ol>
<li>1 assist</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Coolbinia (Home) (Loss)
<ol>
<li>This was a complete embarrassment. We scored 1 goal for the match, which came just before the half time siren. I got it from half back and centred it after running 80 meters to Uwane who dribbled it home</li>
<li>1 assist</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Wembley (Away) (Win)
<ol>
<li>3 goals
<ol>
<li>First was in the third quarter, a shaky stab shot from directly in front</li>
<li>Second from the right behind post (a checkside) on the run (fourth quarter)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Third was probably my finest. I gathered a bouncing ball from about 25 meters out, and I couldn&rsquo;t checkside or dribble far enough (I&rsquo;m a right footer, and it was to the left of the goals). I had to duck a tackle, swerve around and I slipped as I kicked the goal</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>4 assists (one in each quarter)</li>
</ol>[/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title="My Life Goals" _builder_version="3.0.51" open="on"]<p style="text-align: justify;">Ever since I was 4, I've wanted to do something to do with science as a career. From an astronaut to an astrobiologist, to a robot designer and developer, my interests have always had something to do with space - which I am absolutely fascinated with. I predict I will get an ATAR of above 70, which will allow me to get into the university courses that I want to do. Any one of these sorts of jobs will make me happy (just one):</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Robot designer</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Robot coder</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Astronaut</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Astrobiologist</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">(Anything to do with space/chemistry/physics and research)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are obviously other things that I'm interested in, for example photography, materials &amp; design, and of course the AoD (I'll be talking about the AoD in the next tab).</p>
<h2>Photography</h2>
<p>I started photography in Year 8 at Perth Modern, and I've loved it. I consider it as a hobby, and if that was my full-time job I would probably not be fullfulled (I guess you can determine from my above paragraphs that I want to do something to do with science for a living). I believe I'm good at it and got an A in my exam, but it's not something that I would want to do for a living.</p>
<p>Soon, I'll be showing a gallery of my best photos (under Community -&gt; Liam's Stuff in the top menu) that I've taken.</p>
<h2>Materials &amp; Design</h2>
<p>In Year 7, we did a term of each elective and each language. In term 1, I did woodwork with Mr Trent (one of the best teachers in the school). I did wordwork in Year 8 &amp; 9, and electronics with Mr Trent in Year 9 as well (both semesters). I wasn't able to fit it into my timetable in senior school, however I continue to use some of the skills I learnt from those classes in the things I do today, including building our droids! The electronics was especially useful, as I learnt basic wiring and soldering techniques which will be useful when doing the electronics of our droids.</p>
<p>Like photography, I consider materials &amp; design as more of a hobby, but it can be used for the things I am passionate about.</p>
<p></p>[/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title="The AoD & Me" _builder_version="3.0.51"]<p>I believe that I will continue to be part of the AoD until I die. Here's my best-case scenario roadmap of our history:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formation - 2015</li>
<li>Completion of first motorized droid - 2019</li>
<li>25 members (including "big brother figures" - see below) - 2020</li>
<li>Companion Droids being sold - 2024</li>
<li>University degree - 2025/26 (for me - the AoD members/droidlings will help me with this...see below also)</li>
<li>Project Scorpius (coming soon) - first phase completed by 2026/27</li>
<li>Bought out by a "big brother company" (still can control the "droids", same board, control of portal, but distributed under a different company's name) (I'll explain why this is important to me below) - 2030+</li>
<li>I resign from the position of Chairman on the Board - 2050-60 but stay on the Board as a regular board member</li>
<li>I die - hopefully 2080+</li>
</ul>
<p>What do I mean by big brother? Well, in the case of "big brother figure" I mean someone like Josh Richards (joshrichards.space) that is an insider on my dreams - he's a physicist and an aspiring Mars astronaut. Even if he doesn't get there, he's done so much for Mars One (not just publicity, also stuff that is actually science) that he's still someone like that to me. Obviously, I hope (and probably will, especially with the help of the AoD) to get there, but it's always nice to have someone in the industry and in the AoD and this is one of my goals.</p>
<p>In terms of big brother companies, I'm talking about NASA, CSIRO, ARSE (Australian Research into Space Exploration), Mars One, SpaceX, etc. Basically a company that has good values and does something to do with science that can take care of the AoD. The reason I want to do this is because it is sort of a gift to a company that is important to me. I would have created a valuable asset using my skills - and of course the skills of all the droidlings - to a company that will honour that tradition by turning into a commercial company as well as a not-for-profit - if that makes sense. Ever since I started planning my life's roadmap, it always had something to do with giving&nbsp; more than personal service to a company that I would work for. It involved giving a gift of scientific worth. If it turns into a purchase, the money will be split the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>40% will go to the board
<ul>
<li>Of that, 20% will go to the CEO</li>
<li>20% will go to the Chairman (probably me)</li>
<li>The other 60% will be split equally among the members of the board</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>10% will go to the Droids Council, with the same splitting up as the regular executive board</li>
<li>50% will be split up equally among the remaining members</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is no purchase, I will make sure that the members of the AoD will be rewarded for their services.</p>
<p>The terms will be these:</p>
<ul>
<li>That every member will retain the right to continue working for the AoD after the purchase</li>
<li>The AoD portal will only be touched by those working for the AoD</li>
<li>The AoD will describe the minimum requirements for droids created after the purchase of the AoD to ensure that our future droids maintain the quality since the formation of the AoD</li>
<li>For at least the first 10 years after the purchase, there must be at least 2 board members from the original AoD (unless there are less than 2 wanting to be on the board)</li>
<li>The buyers must distribute under the AoD logo somewhere visible</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, part of the AoD is to help everyone achieve their goals. My goal is to get a uni degree/TAFE diploma and take part in a dream job, whether that be building rockets for NASA or doing experiments that advance science at the AoD. I will do my best to help each droidling with their goals.</p>
<p>I intent to have a physical location where every physical record, including original droids, will be stored (and have a virtual version online that is created as a sort of cross-between a live-feed and a game). The AoD is so important to me that I will hopefully (eventually) live on the AoD property and I intend my body to rest there. I intend to make sure that the AoD lives on after me but I will still be a part of it even after I'm gone.</p>
<p>Sorry, I'm starting to tear up here. Thanks so much for reading, and thanks for making my life that bit more magical!</p>
