And our two finalists are: Dom &amp; Liam (Russell).

Here they are:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Liam Russell's LOGO:</span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dom's LOGO:</span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-384" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Alliance-of-droids-logo.png" alt="Alliance of droids logo" width="625" height="550" />Thanks to everyone who participated. These are our two logos. Liam's one will be the one for our badges, pins &amp; other perks, while Dom will have hers as the official logo. We are going to edit the colors of hers but every gay pride day we will switch the logo back to the rainbow theme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This could not have happened without those who participated. Thanks a lot!</p>
