<h1 style="text-align: center;">NEW BLOG SERIES!</h1>
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua', Palatino;">Yes, that's right, I am starting a new blog series on Liam's Blog which will be about human rights and my thoughts on it. This will be a 3-part series that will include my thoughts on bullying, discrimination, and domestic violence. These 3 subjects have been a major problem in my country as well as for me, and I want to get this out on the web to show my support for victims of bullying, discrimination, and domestic violence.</span>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Bullying</h1>
Let's start with bullying. Bullying is something I have experienced pretty much all through my school life, and it STILL continues to this day. Believe it or not, though, there are plenty of rules and legislations against bullying. In this post, I will talk about how to prevent bullying, the legislations, and rules about it, some statistics and horrific bullies, my experiences, and also if you or anyone else is in need of help, please call 13 11 14 (@LifelineAust). Help is just a call away.Â <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3089" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Stop-Bullying.png" alt="" width="466" height="334" />
