All members are able to join the Droid Department right now. All members are able to participate in the Droid Contest.&nbsp;

Basically you have a few options for the droid contest:
<ul>
	<li>Design a new type of droid</li>
	<li>Build a droid...any type will count...</li>
	<li>Create or make a type of electronics for the droid</li>
	<li>Create an innovation idea that could be used in the future for our droids</li>
</ul>
One of my favourite ideas is having a special watch that can be used to control the droid. Here a few ideas for that:
<ul>
	<li>Band like the BB-8 Sphero (S.E.) Force Band that controls the droid's movement</li>
	<li>Smart watch app (like R2-Touch)</li>
	<li>Custom band</li>
</ul>
The requirements for the droid are:
<ul>
	<li>Able to move&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Have our logo on it (in any spot)</li>
</ul>
You could even make a small version of a droid as long as it can move. I am planning to make a smaller scale droid (maybe with BB-8's electronics) that can be carried in a special briefcase.

There are no limits for team size!

I am currently looking for team members for Liam'z Droidz &amp; Co.&nbsp;

You can make more than one droid!

When you finish the project, we may be able to put it up on the portfolio page: portfolio.allianceofdroids.com

If you want your own page email me!

My page will be liamzdroids.allianceofdroids.com

Stay tuned - this contest is a 1 year contest repeated every year, starting on the 23rd of December, so get planning!
Thanks everyone!
