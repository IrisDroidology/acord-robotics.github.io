<h1>Last Time</h1>
In the last post, I talked about my relationship with my family. I gave information about who I prefer, their rating, and why it is so. I talked about the strengths of the relationship and themselves as well. Today I am going to be talking about some odd things about me that I didnâ€™t mention in the first post of this series. I will also talk about my passions and why they mean so much to me. I hope you enjoy, and please leave your comments about your own experiences or thoughts below!
<h1>Space &amp; Science - MY BIGGEST PASSION!</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ever since I was 4 years old, I have been OBSESSED with science and astronomy. I have gone through different phases in my obsession, but it all revolves around the same thing - science and astronomy. I find astronomy so interesting because it has so many different things to discover - so many things that may never be discovered in my lifetime. Astronomy is a never-ending mystery; whenever we answer one question, three more pop up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Science is also very important to me. I will not feel like I have accomplished anything if I don't become some sort of scientist. Being a scientist is all I want to be, Going into space would be cool, but it is not my main goal in life. I want to help people with my discoveries, help animals with my discoveries, and just make the world a better place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My favorite type of science is space and robotics, but I also love technology, biology, chemistry, geology, and physics. I don't want to become a doctor, and I don't want to be a biologist. I find both very interesting career paths, but that is not what I would like to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Making a companion robot, which is what we are doing at the Alliance of Droids, is one of my main goals. Helping kids, and helping abused people, victims of war, etc. is another goal of mine. I have always been enticed by a detective job, because I could be doing scientific research but also be helping people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Creating a new, revolutionary type of communication device could also be pretty cool, but when I say technology I mean things like rockets and outer space tools. Making a new space suit, creating a base on Mars, etc. is what I mean by that.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Gaming &amp; Tech - The New Age</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like a lot of kids my age, I love gaming and technology. I have a Samsung Tablet, a Samsung Phone, an iPod 5G, an HP Laptop, an xBox One, an eReader, an electronic guitar, and a LOT of games. I like video games because it allows me to get out of the life I live in, and it provides a portal to a life where I don't get bullied or feel sad. Minecraft is special to me because I can build stuff and work for the rewards.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Schoolwork - An Odd Passion?</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not many kids that I know would admit to liking school work as much that it would be a passion of theirs, but I know that I need to work hard at school to accomplish my goals. Schoolwork is fun in classes like Photography, Woodwork, Math, Science, Social Sciences, English, and sometime Sport, but I get bullied a lot and this makes me reluctant to go to school (sometimes).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As long as the teachers are nice, I have friends, and the schoolwork is interesting, I love school. I go to an academically-selective school. I learn lessons in both academic and life areas. Going on the train and bus everyday is a good experience that I have learnt many things from.</p>
