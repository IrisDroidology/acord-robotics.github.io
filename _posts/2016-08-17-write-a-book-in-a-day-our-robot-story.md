<p style="text-align: justify;">I am participating in a competition called Write a book in a day. The name says it all. Basically I am writing a book with a group of friends and am going to send it to a judge, who will judge it and give me a certificate. I am not sure what type of book I will be writing, as we have to come up with (most of it) on the day. Since there are 4 members in our group, we need to raise $240 together. We are able to get sponsors to get the money, and we are going to publish the book on this website so you will be able to view it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another announcement is that I, along with some of my friends at school, are doing an English project about robots. We want to publish it on this site, so those two will become temporary admins so they can publish the work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We want people to be able to see our work in literature and show people about our values. Thanks!</p>
