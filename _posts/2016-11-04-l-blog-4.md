<h1 style="text-align: center;">Today...</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After not having posted for a while, I am back with another blog entry. I will be going over the usual stuff but also adding some stuff about controversial activities around the world. I hope you enjoy!</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Interesting Articles</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Just quickly, I will say that I believe the Astrobiology Magazine has been closed down.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Steven Avery - ABC News</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">[button size="default" url="www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-02/making-a-murderer-lawyers-dna-testing-steven-avery-innocence/7988638" open_new_tab="true" text="Article - Aussie News" icon="" type="default" bottom_margin=""]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">I have been a big fan of the Making A Murderer series since it first aired on Netflix last year. For those that don't know what it is about, it is basically following the story of a man (Steven Avery) who was convicted of a violent rape he did not commit. Two years after he was released (after spending 18 years in prison), he was again jailed, this time for a controversial murder and is unlikely that Steven committed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">I find it interesting because of the fact he was set up and it is also incredibly hooking - I can't stop watching it!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">This article is about the new DNA experiments that could be used to prove Avery didn't commit the murder and was instead set up. Ironically, he was freed because of DNA evidence as well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Dean Strang &amp; Jerry Butting are two of the current lawyers of Steven Avery. A couple of nights ago, they did an interview for the news programÂ <em>Lateline</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">I still believe he is innocent, as I always have, even though it would mean an innocent man losing 3 decades of his life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Steven was released on the 11th of September, 2003, and two years later, in 2005, he was put in jail again. He was originally released because of startling new DNA evidence. It is funny that he could be released because of DNA evidence again.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Apparently Steven's blood was found in the car of Teresa Halbach (<em>deceased)</em>, but the new testing method could prove that the blood was from years earlier, so he was set up.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">Teresa's car keys were also found in Steven Avery's bedroom, but when the detectives searched theÂ <em>exact sameÂ </em>area they found nothing. The special prosecutor said that the keys were found when the detective moved a set of slippers, but in my opinion he was framed again.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">If Steven had used bleach to remove all of Teresa's blood and DNA, how could he be so dumb as to not remove his own?</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">MILO - Let's Make Robots (Cool Robot Idea &amp; Tutorial)</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">First up, the reason why this is also in the Sp~S6 category is because MILO is a robot with a design I like and will be a great idea for our future companion droids.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">You can view it here:Â [button size="default" url="http://letsmakerobots.com/node/49322" open_new_tab="true" text="MILO|LMR Robot" icon="" type="default" bottom_margin=""]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Thanks to this article, I now understand a bit more about the drive system - which is basically what motorizes the droid/robot.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Guide to Making Star Wars Robots (Let's Make Robots)</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">I have mentioned this article before, but I think I should give a more in-depth review of this blog post.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">You can view it here:Â [button size="default" url="http://letsmakerobots.com/node/50657" open_new_tab="true" text="Ultimate Guide to Building Droids" icon="" type="default" bottom_margin=""]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">This article includes a whole bunch of references that I will check out and leave at the end of this part of the blog.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">T1000 gives a good introduction about why he likes building robots and why he likes Star Wars - in fact, I see a lot of similarity between us! I agree with him about the fact that The Force Awakens is sorta known as 'OMG - THEY DIDN'T RUIN IT!' - because, while I love the prequels, I must admit I was nervous about how the movie would turn out, considering that it was hard to come up with fresh material.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">T1000 also talks about what he thinks about the tutorials he lists, which is good if you only have time to view the blog and not enough time to view every single tutorial hoping to find what you're looking for.</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">MY WORK</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">As you can often see in my cover images, I also talk about my work in the Alliance of Droids and also outside of it. I believe I am talented in things that I do, but not everything. Here I would like to talk about things I have been doing behind the scenes for the Alliance of Droids, as well as some other things not to do with the Alliance of Droids.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">On the Facebook group, The Astromech Alliance, I have been busy posting information and questions about various droid figures and robots that I think will look good in our Droidfolio, which I will talk about later. I have been busy browsing eBay for various droids, and I have found some ones that I think will be a good fit - R3-S6, R6-H5, R2-D2, R4-G9, R4-P17, and some others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Out of the Alliance of Droids, I have been busy getting bullied at school, which I'm used to...</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">What is the Droidfolio?</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">The Droidfolio is basically what we add to our droids. We are planning to add Astromech figures, like the Build-A-Droid figures from Disney, as a sort of badge system for our different droids. These will be stuck onto our various droids.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">The Droidfolio is also a collection of all our research, orders (for our CD's), some example parts, and photos. We are planning to put the Droidfolio of each droid in their frame.Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">The Droidfolio will also be up and running on this site shortly.</span></p>
