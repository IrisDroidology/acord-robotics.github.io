<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">This is a special!</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">As you can probably tell by the title, this post is a SPECIAL. It is a special because it is extra long and has more than just what is usually in my blog. It is also dedicated to a few people, including Joseph Palmer (AKA The PrawnStar/HGTPSH) and Carl Sagan (astronomer - died 1990). I hope you enjoy!</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Regular Stuff</strong></em></h1>

<hr />

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Interesting BooksÂ </span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The first interesting book that I have read is called The Doctor, by Doctor Karl Kruszelnicki, and was published in 2016 (this year). It follows his usual structure, which is basically talking about 20-40+ interesting scientific topics that may or may not be controversial. Regardless, Dr Karl shines some light on these topics, is not afraid to admit that scientistsÂ <em>don't know</em> the answer, and makes it easy for even non science geeks to understand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I have been a big fan of Dr Karl since I first talked to him on the radio in 2013. Every Thursday, he does a radio section where he lets you ask questions about science. I was having an appointment that day so that is how I could talk to him, as it was during school time. I asked him about amino acids and comets, and I remember the radio presenter saying that I was only 10 so give me a simplified answer - but I probably could've understood the 'not simple' answer, not to boast though :).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I will leave that story here for now, as I want to talk about it in the special part.Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1243" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/97817435474271.jpeg" alt="97817435474271" width="235" height="356" /></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ff00;">Interesting Articles</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ff00;">I want to talk about some articles about Autism Spectrum Disorder first. As you will know by now, I have ASD. I want to share some inspirational stories with you so it can inspire you. The Alliance of Droids also has a program for people - kids and adults - to talk about their disability and maybe do a series about it. Anyway, on with the articles!</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://learningworksforkids.com/2015/04/research-say-video-games-good-children-affected-autism-spectrum-disorder/">Autism &amp; Gaming</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This article, fromÂ <a style="color: #000000;" href="learningworksforkids.com" target="_blank">LearningWorksForKids</a>, is important to me because I myself love gaming. I absolutely love it. It allows me to get into another world, away from stress and bullies. I have choices and can do things I probably never could in real life (like punching wood - thanks Minecraft!).Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Technology has become a part of our lives now. Most adults in well-off countries have at least one electronic device each, and kids also have technology as well. But having said that, I want to say that there are tons of people in other countries that don't get access to even fresh water, while we live like Kings (compared to them). There should be more houses for people living there instead of giving actual citizens bad houses and giving the rich - or the tourists - great houses. Even today, the rich live better than the poor, and in some countries the rich get all the food and resources. Not all of them are bad people, they just can't imagine life without what they have. Why do tourists get better houses than regular citizens?Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Before I continue with the actual article, I want to make a suggestion. Why don't we organize a government program to give these people chances to live like we do, chances to live here and not have to spend 10 years in an island off the coast of Australia?Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Anyway, this article was the first thing I clicked on when I looked up autism spectrum disorder articles - because it is something that is understudied, even in this day and age when almost EVERYONE has a phone, computer, etc. So I clicked on it. It outlines the pros and cons of video games for kids on the spectrum.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I agree that kids on the spectrum need to interact with more living things, and 'switch off,' but I also agree that people on the spectrum require/rely on things that can be easily accessed on a device, and plus these people don't always have the best social skills.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For me, I interact with others very strangely. I can't always take jokes, but then I make jokes in the same category that I think will make others laugh when some would consider it rude. I swear a bit, but that is mostly because of the influences I have when most kids at my school swear. IÂ also react strongly to things, which is considered 'bullying,' when it is just my way of saying stop it and go away. I seem to draw in the attention of the bullies more than most kids do, because of my odd passions and peculiar behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I find technology cool because it can't bully me, only the people whoÂ <em>useÂ </em>it can. I can use it for things like writing, gaming and more and it is fun for me to do it. But I often spend too much on these devices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I agree with the first point that the article says - that computers are now an integral part of academic performance. I prefer writing on a computer because of all the extra features, and that it is faster and neater. Computers allow me to explore the Earth with a few clicks, or share documents with my friends. I, and my other autistic friends, seem to do better in computerised activities because I can actually interact with the diagrams and take neat notes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I agree with the second point as well - that it increases attention. I feel more motivated to talk to a computer, and it is easier as well as I also have issues with facial expressions and eye contact. This way I don't have to do all the 'hard' things that I would have to do with a human.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many studies have shown that people on the spectrum are better with visual tools. As I have said, many times, we interact better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like on gaming servers and Steam, we can collaborate with others over the internet. We don't have to be at each other's places to help each other with something. We can game on the same world and build stuff together. We learn more about social skills doing something we like to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1244" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/autcraft.jpg" alt="autcraft" width="851" height="315" /></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.beyondyourblog.com/18-places-to-publish-your-writing-about-autism/" target="_blank">Blogs on Autism</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a slightly different article, because it provides links to other websites. But I must put it in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically it talks about places to publish your blogs on autism spectrum disorder, either as a parent, friend or autistic person. It would be cool to maybe organize a collaboration between one of these blogging groups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, that is it. If any of you have any stories on those sites, or maybe want to share your stories, we can help you put them on here on behalf of you!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1246" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/april-is-autism-awareness-month.png" alt="april-is-autism-awareness-month" width="500" height="322" /></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.debate.org/opinions/are-we-creating-more-terrorists" target="_blank">Are WE Creating Terrorists?</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Terrorism is probably one of the most dangerous things facing us RIGHT NOW. In Australia, we know - think - that ISIS/Al Qaeda are the bad guys and are doing the most unspeakable things. But let's step back a bit. Are we any better? They are fighting for their religion - and also their freedom and revenge. The 'whites' have deprived them of freedom, they say. This is partly true, as we tend to keep our resources to ourselves, hence our complex trade agreements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We often don't look at two parts of the story. And in fact, there are more than two sides. But let's look at the pros and cons of the 'whites' first.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We perceive ISIS as a threat. But are they really much of a threat without us? Of course, they will keep killing people, and I don't mean letting them do that. But we are killing them, doing things just as - or even more so - than they are. If we strike one down, they will strike us down in revenge. If we had a cease-fire, they would stop firing at us, and vice-versa. If we opened negotiation talks, people would be seen to be doing the right thing. But we aren't doing any of this. All we are doing is continuing the onslaught, and don't tell me that the government is too dumb to realize this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let's go back a few years, to when Tony Abbot (Australian Prime Minister) was first in power. He denied us the right to have gay marriage, and I think I know the reason why - in fact I do. Abbot was a Christian. I don't have anything against Christians, but I am heavily atheist and think that religion does more harm than good. But anyway, Abbot was a Christian - a devout one. Most of the readers of the Bible know that Christians were against gay marriage, and the Bible has also 'taught' us to accept males as the dominant, better gender. These people read through the bad stuff, and focus on what theyÂ <em>wantÂ </em>to believe. It is fine to be religious but it is not fine to deprive people of their rights, marriage rights, equality rights, because of religion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Crusades are another good example. The British, French, and some others fought against the 'stealers of the Holy Land,' in the name of God. I mean, come on! They were probably looking for glory and loot. They also wanted to avoid going to Hell. The church was the real King - whatever the Church/Pope said, all Christians had to do. They had to slaughter Jews and other non-Christians because they weren't Holy or Pure. The Church gave them power to do this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am sorry if this is against your beliefs, but I know that religion is giving us reasons to do terrible things - killing Jews because they were not Holy. The church was able to make money by raiding the Jewish towns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What does this have to do with terrorism, you ask? Well, let's get to it - Christians are mainly from continents like America &amp; Europe. Muslims, Islamic's &amp; Hindi are from the Middle East and India. We raided their countries in the Crusades - but this is not the main reason. It is because of our religion that we continue to deny people of other religions - and we still make petty excuses about why we do it - I shot him because he was trying to shoot me! We wantÂ <em>powerÂ </em>- like the Germans did in the 1910s. The people in those areas, especially isolated areas that are free from the 'Christian toxics,' are able to speak freely and organize a group like ISIS. They never forget. They also want power, but if religion didn't exist, we wouldn't have these wars. I'm not saying that we wouldn't have wars at all, but we would be more of a species, instead of 100's of different races, if we didn't have all these religions clouding science and reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would just like to say this - keep on believing in your God. I am not wanting to take that from you. Just remember to keep in mind that ISIS, while not doing the right thing, sort of have a valid point and that religion shouldn't get in the way of science, cooperation, and trust.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">End of regular stuff...</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would just like to thank you guys for reading my rants about terrorism and the like. If you enjoyed what you read, please remember to comment that down below, as long as what you want to see me talk about next. Here is the special stuff.</p>


<hr />

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><em>Special Stuff</em></h1>

<hr />

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tributes</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">People die, everyday. We don't mourn every death, simply because we don't have time and we don't know everyone's names. But this person never knew me, but I want to give out a tribute to him nonetheless.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Joseph Palmer (PrawnStar, HGTPSH)</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joseph Palmer was one of my favorite youtubers, and that is the truth. I would've loved it if he could've done a proper Let's Play series, but I loved the way he played Minecraft.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joe passed away three years ago. His mum, Natasha, has sort of taken over his YouTube channel, which had 9,000 subscribers at the time of his death and now has about 30,000. The sad thing about this is that he only became famous after people realized that there were no more videos from him, like with Vincent Van Gogh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joe's stepdad had 40 ThePrawnStar stickers made up for various subs, and I received one a couple of months back after befriending Natasha on FaceBook.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of these days I will do a tribute video to Joe, and I would love it if you could watch it. So would Joe, if he was still here. I don't believe in afterlives, but I want Joe to be happy nonetheless.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[button size="default" url="https://www.youtube.com/user/hgtpsh" open_new_tab="true" text="Support Joe NOW!" icon="" type="default" bottom_margin=""]</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">About Me - Exclusive Info!</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This section is going to be about my habits, some more about my passions, and my dreams. I hope that it will allow you to understand more about me and Autism in general.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">My (Not-So-Good) Habits</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now I know what you're thinking - he's spilling the beans, let's make fun of him! Or something like that. But I would like it if you did not bully me or others about my habits - they are part of me and they are not your problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am not embarrassed to have my habits on the internet, as it is helping others be confident and helping people understand more about people like me.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Teddy Bears...</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[button size="default" url="https://www.facebook.com/autismbears" open_new_tab="true" text="Autism Bears " icon="" type="default" bottom_margin=""]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I still love teddies, even to this day. My most favorite teddy bear was known as Gilbert and I will include a picture of him. I loved him because I never had friends and he was my friend. I have had him since I was about 1. Last year, 365 days ago, I 'put him to sleep,' and I haven't looked back since.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Teddy Bears make me feel comfortable because they can be with me almost everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eventually my mum stitched him up and I got him back in June for a bit. The photo shows me with my Chess Medal and him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I still sleep with them sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1261" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/20160623_160314-614x1024.jpg" alt="20160623_160314" width="614" height="1024" /></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Over-reacting</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As many of the kids at my school would know, I over-react a lot to bullies at school. Part of this is because of my disability, while some of it is because of my personality and temperament.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I guess I over-react because I don't see others saying stuff to other kids, and I believe that they are singling me out. I know it isn't a good thing but neither is picking me out and making me feel bad.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">My Hobbies</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have a large amount of hobbies, as I have stated a lot. In this section I will be talking about my favorite ones and why they are my hobbies.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Reading</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have been reading since I was very, very young. I read a lot of books, and my bedroom is filled with books. I don't have a favorite genre, because I read so many genres that I can't decide on which is my favorite. I read a bit of adventure books, like The 39 Clues. I read heaps of Star Wars books and I also read about technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am very tech-savvy. I read magazines every few weeks about the latest technology, including PC &amp; Tech Authority and Techlife. I find it interesting because I am amazed how things keep getting discovered and made all the time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I read Harry Potter quite a bit, but I can't say that it is in my favorites list. Far from it. I read it because I am sometimes bored with other books and need something 'fresh' to read.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Blogging</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The large amount of blogging that I do proves this. It lets me share my story and I enjoy doing it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1198" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/keep-calm-and-join-the-alliance-22.png" alt="keep-calm-and-join-the-alliance-22" width="600" height="700" /></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Â Others...</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have so many hobbies, but I have mentioned quite a few in this blog post and others. I hope you can find them :)</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">My Dreams</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My main dream is becoming a scientist and making a breakthrough discovery. But I have other dreams, like ridding the world of discrimination and world peace. While these may or may not be realistic goals, I still mention them because it shows who I am.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My first dream, becoming a scientist, means the world to me. I often say that my greatest fear is not becoming a scientist, which is completely true. I fell in love with science when I was 3 and have loved every second of it since.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many types of sciences, and my favorites are robotics, astronomy and chemistry. I look at people like Brian Cox &amp; Dr Karl for inspiration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Â <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1263" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/20160817_142534-1024x768.jpg" alt="20160817_142534" width="625" height="469" />I want to design a companion robot because I love Star Wars (R2-D2 included), and it is a type of science. That is probably my favorite goal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1262" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/20160816_140830-1024x614.jpg" alt="20160816_140830" width="625" height="375" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is why I join several different groups, like LetsMakeRobots, because I want to share my creations with the world.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">My Favorite Movies</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I absolutely adore Star Wars because it fits in with all of my dreams, ambitions and is incredibly 'cool.' The droids are droid-tastic, the Jedi are Peacekeepers, and it has a great story line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was first introduced to Star Wars when I was in the third grade. I watched the first movie (the fourth one - A New Hope) and then was hooked. I especially loved the droids and Han Solo. In my opinion, Luke is a bit bland - a bit empty. But some heroes need to be like that. Han Solo brims with personality, and I see a lot of him in me - or maybe it's the other way around.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My other favorite movies include Interstellar, The Martian, and Robots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1272" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MV5BMTc2MTQ3MDA1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA3OTI4NjE@._V1_UY1200_CR9006301200_AL_-538x1024.jpg" alt="mv5bmtc2mtq3mda1nl5bml5banbnxkftztgwoda3oti4nje-_v1_uy1200_cr9006301200_al_" width="538" height="1024" /></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">My Favorite Books</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I love books that have a secret message in them. A book that I can't remember the name of talks about a robot that grew jealous of the other toys and started being mean to them. Eventually the kid's dad gave him a dog. This struck home with me because I see myself in the robot. The droid R3-S6 (Star Wars, The Clone Wars, Series 1, Ep 6 &amp; 7) is like this. He was brainwashed and betrayed Anakin but was killed by R2-D2. I want my droid to be a cross-between of R2 &amp; R3 to commemorate this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The movies that I mentioned above are also my favorite books, but some others include The 39 Clues &amp; some non-fiction books about space and science.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1273" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/download-1.jpg" alt="download-1" width="294" height="171" /></p>
