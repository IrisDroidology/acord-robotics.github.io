<h1 style="text-align: center;">This Blog Is For...</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This blog is for my personal views on the world and my passions. It is for me to talk about what I have done in the Alliance of Droids. And it is for me to talk about myself and teach you guys some tricks and tools about life and AS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Feel free to comment on this blog. Feel free to share it. Just don't say it's your own work, or post abusive comments or ads. These comments will be deleted and your account &amp; IP address banned.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Cool Articles that I have read</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this section I post information that may or may not be relevant to the Alliance of Droids, but regardless I find it interesting. I do not own this work! I am only commenting on it, providing my views and providing an excerpt if possible.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/solve/work-with-nasa" target="_blank">Work With NASA (NASA Article #1)</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a lot of you know, I amÂ <em>obsessedÂ </em>with space &amp; NASA. It is still one of my many, many dreams to work there, as a space science engineer or an astrobiologist. It would be incredibly cool to explore planets, but I don't think I am able to do that job. Building space probes and robots is pretty cool. Anyway, let's get on with the article!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">There are a number of ways to work with NASA on challenge activities. Individuals or external organizations can work with NASA to design, administer, study, or provide feedback on NASA challenges in a variety of ways:</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Other federal agencies can work through NASA to gain experience with running challenges</span></li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Contractors, grantees, nonprofits, and commercial entities can design and administer challenges with or for NASA</span></li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Researchers seeking to study NASAâ€™s experience with open innovation work can arrange to study NASA challenges</span></li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Anyone can provide feedback on specific challenge concepts</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let's just pause it there for a second. We are a non-profit organisation; while not being a registered charity we support people with disabilities, and we would love to help NASA with some sort of experiment. While NASA is mainly thought of as a space agency, it is actually a group of people working together to solve problems in space and other sciences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Nonprofits can design and administer challenges with or for NASA</em>. This one is important. If we can get a partnership with NASA, maybe designing a space probe, or even helping us with our projects or raising awareness, it would be a big win.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I myself want to study NASA's experience, and I want to study NASA challenges. This would mean that I can have experience for the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Several organizations have applied for NASA grants to conduct challenges for public benefit relating to NASAâ€™s mission, including awarding prizes (such as business plan competitions) and conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science activities. Organizations seeking to conduct challenge activities with NASA grant funds should propose these types of projects through specific grant notices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This could be useful, as we are an organisation working for the benefit of the public.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/space-robotics-challenge" target="_blank">Space Robotics Challenge</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Alliance of Droids wants to create companion robots that can provide comfort and companionship to the buyers, especially people with disabilities. We won't participate in this because we aren't experienced enough, but it gave me an idea to maybe let potential buyers download a simulator of our robots, and then they could comment on what they think should be added.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/big-idea-challenge-0" target="_blank">NASA's BIG IDEA CHALLENGE</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This closes on the 30th of November this year. And it is only open to undergraduates. But hopefully we can create some sort of innovative idea or design for a space probe/mission/ship/etc. and send it to NASA.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/programs/descriptions/Students-rd.html" target="_blank">Student Projects (NASA)</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dream come true! There are a few projects that are available for kids my age and that are available internationally.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">My Work - October 2016</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have done a lot of work this month. I also turned 14! I have been on a posting frenzy, setting up Multisite, adding new members, etc. etc. But today I want to talk about my most important work this month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First up, Professor Jane Burns. Yesterday I met her, and she just blew me away with the service I got. It was heartwarming to believe that I may be able to put my AoD dreams into a reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, the Companion Robots. I have been posting about these A LOT lately, and for good reason. I am happy that I have received information from BlueFrogRobotics and am also pretty sure it could become a reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, I have to say thanks to the members for THEIR/YOUR work. You guys make us better. Thank you!</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">My Views on the World</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I like to say what I mean and what I think. I have views on the world that may seem completely ridiculous to you, but I believe what I say. I like to talk about politics, terrorism, religion, science, and economics, especially Australia's economy.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">STOP TERRORISM!</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1196" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wruAa3mx.jpeg" alt="wruaa3mx" width="406" height="406" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I am strongly against terrorism. While terrorists may sayÂ <em>IÂ </em>am a terrorist because I don't follow the Christian/Muslim religions, but I just think that people need to stop killing each other because of their beliefs. I mean, seriously - the Americans are killing as well. But there is another side to this argument - sometimes you have to kill to protect. The IS group (Islamic State) is holding prisoners and will not release them if we don't surrender.Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That being said, killing people isn't the only option. Far from it. Well, not killing hundreds upon hundreds of INNOCENT people. Killing the leaders may work occasionally, but most of the time someone else, someone worse, will become the new leader. The goal should be to educate, not massacre.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both sides believe that they are in the right. This doesn't make them right, but if they sincerely believe that they are doing the right thing, you can't change that. Some people are forced to do it; they need the money, food, etc. for their family, for example. This doesn't make them bad people, they just made bad decisions. Taking the life of someone should hurt and consume everyone, but the level of hurt should be based off of WHY you killed them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we can educate these people, maybe open negotiations, we would be safe. I have been bought up to believe that these people won't listen to anyone but themselves. A lot of them won't. But some join terrorist groups to fight for what theyÂ <em>believeÂ </em>in. We can't take their religion away from them. They kill because theyÂ <em>thinkÂ </em>- or are taught - that they have to. Education is the key.</p>
