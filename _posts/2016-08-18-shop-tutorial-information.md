<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe that GoDaddy allow us to get subdomains for our sites (for free). If this is true we will point our shop to either www.shop.allianceofdroids.com or .org.au.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Either way, the shop will still work the same way regardless. We will have sections for the member perks, where you have to be LOGGED IN with your role to get the badges/pins/gemstones you need. If you ordered one of our products, go to the checkout, which is where you will have to pay. If you can email me (@ allianceofdroids@gmail.com) with proof that you have a disability (like a diagnosis certificate, etc.), we will set up a temporary account where you can get one of our droids, models, etc. for a hugely discounted price.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The shop is going to be very easy to use, and we hope you guys will like it!</p>
