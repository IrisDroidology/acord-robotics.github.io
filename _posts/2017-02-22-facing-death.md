<h1 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Death is one of the things that people fear the most. Death is like the event horizon of a black hole - there is no return after you pass it. You will never be aware of anything after you die.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This post is all about people and fictional characters that have faced death, looked it in the eye, and have done the right thing.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Part One - Fictional Characters</h1>
[caption id="attachment_9514" align="aligncenter" width="194"]<img class=" size-full wp-image-9514 aligncenter" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/AjjVntrs-SW-TCW-FD-1.jpg" alt="AjjVntrs SW TCW FD #1" width="194" height="259" /> Asajj Ventress, Star Wars TCW[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify;">While fictional characters are, of course, not real (duh), they often have something inside their character, a message that means something different to everyone. Movies &amp; TV series like Star Wars (&amp; TCW) have many characters with a message, like R2-D2 &amp; C-3PO, Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, Asajj Ventress, and many more. Even Harry Potter has a handful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not all of these characters died, but they all did the right thing and looked death in the eye, accepted their fate. They DID THE RIGHT THING. Let's take a look at these characters...</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader</h2>

[caption id="attachment_9526" align="aligncenter" width="301"]<img class="  wp-image-9526 aligncenter" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/AnknSkywlkr-SW-FD-2.jpg" alt="AnknSkywlkr SW FD #2" width="301" height="376" /> Anakin Skywalker was a Jedi in Star Wars and created balance in the Force[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anakin Skywalker is one of the most famous characters in all of science fiction. Also known as Darth Vader, Anakin was first seen in 1977 asÂ <strong>Darth Vader</strong>, the evil dude. The first Star Wars movie was actually the fourth in the saga!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But to make it easy for you to understand, Anakin was a slave from Tatooine that was born to Shmi Skywalker. Until he was 9, he was enslaved to Watto and some Hutts, so he was basically a slave. Anakin was incredibly force sensitive - he had a huge amount of things called medi-chlorians.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, this post isn't supposed to be a crash course into the characters of Star Wars, but please be patient with me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anakin was tortured by visions of his wife, Padme Amidala, dying in childbirth. The sad thing was that he vowed to make the vision NOT come true, but by trying to save her, he killed her. So visions (in Star Wars) can serve as a reminder of what will happen if you try to stop it, not if you do nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anakin turned to the Dark Side of the Force before his wife's death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As he lay dying in the second Death Star, he whispered to his son Luke</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"You were right. You were right about me, Luke. Tell your sister... you... were...right..."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He died and was cremated by Luke Skywalker.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He died when he overthrew his Sith master, Darth Sidious. He threw Sidious into a pit on the second death star when he tried to save Luke. He redeemed himself by saving his son and bringing balance to the Force (at least for now).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the next post you will see Asajj's post as well as R2-D2's post. I hope to see you there!</p>
