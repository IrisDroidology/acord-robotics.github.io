<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello everyone, I am back. Today I am posting about my team, Liam'z Droidz, and the team update. First thing I have to say is that Andrew Campbell, a member of the Western Australian R2-D2 Builder's Club, is going to be meeting up with me soon, and he is going to be helping me with my droid planning. Hopefully Liam (Russell) will be able to come as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am also going to be buying the BB-8 Sphero S.E. - it is confirmed. Only Droid Builders will be able to see the design planning so far until we unveil it at the next conference, but we will have it ready for you by then!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Still looking for a name for him!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks everyone!</p>
