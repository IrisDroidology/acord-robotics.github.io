<h1 style="text-align: center;">New Series!</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this series, I will be talking about the Companion Inspiration, and also stories about my very short but entertaining life. Today, I want to talk about my very special and lovely dog, Elsie (Terrier). I have had her since I was 10, but before we get into her story, I want to talk about this series in more detail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The CD's are a big part of my life, and I really want them to be a real thing - which is highly possible, if I can get help. But why does having a companion mean so much to me? Well, I know what it is like to be a loner, to have no friends. I know what it is like to really, really want someone to hang out with. Before Elsie, I was mainly on my own. But now, and since I was 10, I have had a very special dog.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Humans band each other into groups, that is how we survive. Without organisation and groups, we would be on our own, or at least without order. We now have friends, at least most of us do. I want to bring joy to kids with my disability, and not just with my robots. If I can show people other companions, maybe the Companion Droid Line will be a success. Dogs, cats, droids, and humans are companions, as are lizards, owls, birds, worms (and other creepy crawlies), and so many more - not all of us like these animals, but everyone is different. Everyone is stimulated by different companions, and these companions can be influential.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Me - Before Elsie</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A special package came in April 2013. An eager little dog, all the way from Melbourne. An eager set of twins, an eager mother. A small cage. All in the airport.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was the small version of our first sight of Elsie. Elsie came on a plane from Melbourne, from the Tiny Town Kennel (Elsie's Kennel name was Tiny Town Thizz Tender). I was with my mum and my twin sister (my dad had chosen to stay at home).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before I had Elsie, I was bullied badly - I still am, but at least I have Elsie with me. I have been bullied since I started primary school, and I still am. But, again, I still have Elsie, and she makes it easier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had a few friends at school, even before Elsie, but they drifted away over time. Having Elsie gave me a rare chance to learn more about companions, and since I received her, that stormy night, I have had more friends than ever. Having Elsie allowed me to have someone to talk to at home, because I could barely talk to my parents about my troubles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before Elsie, I mainly kept my troubles to myself. I knew that if I complained to the teachers, the bullies would get a small telling off, and then pretend to cry or be sorry, and finally continue. I knew that whatever happened, I would never be able to count on the teachers. I had to rely on myself before Elsie.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">My First Thoughts - Elsie</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I didn't really like Elsie very much when we first got her, but I still thought of her as part of the family. I guess that since the only pets I had had before were crabs, a budgie, and fish, I wasn't really sure how to approach her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After about a month, I fell in love with Elsie. I quickly realised the way she would listen, and how she would talk to you. While it is true that dogs don't speak English, I can clearly tell that dogs understand emotions, and because of this, every time I have been sad, angry, happy, or relieved, she has snuggled up to me and comforted me, or enjoyed the moment with me, depending on the emotion. She always knew what I needed, without having to understand my language.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Today - Elsie &amp; Me</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, Elsie and I share a strong relationship. She sometimes sleeps on my bed when I am sick, and I walk her most days. We are one, together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe that Elsie has made me stronger, and that she has made me a better person. I hope that this helps you understand about my companions and maybe helps you choose to get a living companion.</p>
