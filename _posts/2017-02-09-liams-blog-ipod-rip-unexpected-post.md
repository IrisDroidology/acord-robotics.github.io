<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier;">My iPod - A brief story of today's events</span></h1>
<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier;">Today I may have lost my iPod, forever. This is not aÂ happy thought, but I have to come to terms with it. For those that do not know, my iPod (@AoiPoD) is a treasured possession of mine, and I have had it since I was 10. I got it for my 10th birthday. It was a real treasure, a red beauty. But, if you are like me, you tend to lose things. This is what happened:</span>

<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier;">Every day when I go TO school via the train (and mostly bus as well). On Wednesdays I go HOME with my mentor. I first noticed that my iPod was missing from its case after I got off the train this morning. I either left it at home (not likely), left in in my mentor's car, or LEFT IT ON THE TRAIN. I had it yesterday after the train ride, so it could also be at school. The problem is someone could have stolen it - there is almost 0 chance that the train company will be able to prosecute them if they stole it on the train, and at my school there is only a small chance it will get returned.</span>

<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier;">But I will stay strong. Although I love my iPod, I do not need the physical object to bring me joy. I can remember it with photos, memories, and posts on this website. </span>

The iPod is known as Iris_Droid
