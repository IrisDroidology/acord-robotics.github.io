Wordpress multisite is a feature added to Wordpress (a website building platform that we happen to use) that allows multiple site installations on the same network. In plain english, this means that you can have a network of sites based on just one site (so each member can have their own portfolio).

However, by far the best thing about multisite is this: many plugins that we use (Project Manager, Buddypress, BadgeOS) sync across multisite networks, so you can display your badges, droids, etc. on your own portfolio (remember: the official droidfolios are hosted on the portal,Â <em>member droidfolios</em> are hosted on your own portfolio).

This means that we can have multiple themes be compatible with our data. For example, I want to keep thrive, but the badges don't display on the cover image, like it does on Boss or other BuddyBoss themes. I could try using the jonradio multiple themes plugin (we use this for Divi &amp; Thrive, as well as Boss for the login page), however heaps of things (the cover image, the buddypress links, etc.) get stuffed up.

But if we have multisite, we can have all the same user data synced automatically AND have different themes!

Hopefully we can get a back-up plugin that will send our entire network to my OneDrive account (my school account has 1 tb of storage!).

Super admins (me, Sean, Oscar) will be able to create new sites and "moderate" the entire network. Want your own portfolio? Message me at <a href="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/droidlings/droidologyiris/">http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/droidlings/droidologyiris/.</a>

Remember that personal portfolios (for stuff COMPLETELY unrelated to the AoD such as youtube, gaming, etc.) CAN be made, however they will be separate installations and therefore will not have our data synced.

Also, all member droidfolios WILL be droidlings only - to protect the AoD.

The personal portfolios (like my own portfolio, allianceofdroids.org.au/droidologygaming) are separate websites COMPLETELY.

If you guys need more help with understanding WPMU, look at wpbeginner.com, premium.wpmudev.org (the wordpressÂ multisite experts), and the wordpress.org support forums (http://wordpress.org).

I hope I have covered everything, if I haven't I will cover that in a future post.

Thanks for reading, stay safe, be proud, and #GODROIDS!
