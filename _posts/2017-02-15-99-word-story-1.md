<h1 style="text-align: justify;">What is a 99 Word Story?</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of my writing club, we sometimes do a warm-up called 99 word stories. This is a new category in my blog. I hope you enjoy it (Note: this introduction is not included in the actual word count).</p>
