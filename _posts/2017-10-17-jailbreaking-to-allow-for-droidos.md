Just a quick post, I want to notify users of DroidOS (which includes this site) that we are jailbreaking the #AoiPoD (and soon the AoiPhone - once I upgrade my phone) to allow support for remote controlling from the AoTablet for R2-Touch. This is another part of DroidOS that we are advising droid builders to do.
