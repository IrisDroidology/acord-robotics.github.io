<p style="text-align: justify;">Today I will be talking about the great Woo-Commerce Plug-in I have on this WordPress site. I have finished the set-up of it and the store will be in Australian Dollars. I have already made the first product, the inductee badge. It's $5 Australian Dollars to buy and is available to all members.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of our badges will have the Alliance of Droids Logo on it, which means the contest has ended. I will be doing a post covering the entries and show the winner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will be selling our own Soccer/Football Kit, along with the sash, the droids and more. The Football kit will be customizable with your last name on it and the number of your choice. The kit will feature our logo and colors, or you can get a kit based off of the real life soccer clubs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will also be attempting to make our own tablet/phone covers, and maybe eventually our own tablet. That is a long-term dream but will hopefully be accomplished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The droids will have the following options in store:</p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Type of droid</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Material of droid Body, Dome, Legs</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Electronics?</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Wheels?</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Move by itself?</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Theme - Steampunk, Weathered, Polished, Custom</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Colors</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">&amp; More</li>
</ul>
Maybe even selling our own app on the store would be cool as well!
