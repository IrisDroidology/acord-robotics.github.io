<p>The Alliance of
Droids rewards its members by gifting them points, or credits, through the
portal. The credits are given for activities both in the physical world as well
as on the portal, for example working on one of our physical droids or updating
your build log on the portal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your credits can be
used to buy physical and virtual items from other droidlings, as well as get
discounts on items in the shop, and receive materials for droids. Your levels
and badges will also be at least partly based on credits. However, your levels will
not go down if you spend your credits. If they do, send a message to Limo
through his <a href="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/droidlings/droidologyiris/">profile</a>
or email him at limosineyt@allianceofdroids.org.au</p>

<p><strong>Member Tablets</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most expensive
perks - and therefore the hardest to earn - are the member tablets and phones.
These devices are given to the following members:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Board members - both external
     and internal</li><li>Droid Builders</li><li>Department Leaders - minor
     department leaders are not on the board, but major department leaders are</li><li>Members who are eligible to
     be on the Board</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The devices will be
running a special version of Android, called AnDroidOS. It will include special
AoD apps and games, as well as a customized look and feel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can, of course
download AnDroidOS for free without having a pre-designed AoD members tablet.
Go to <a href="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/droidos/">http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/droidos/</a>
to see the lists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other devices, like
iOS, MacOS, Linux &amp; WindowsOSÂ  will have special apps and games
designed for that platform but the devices you get from the member perks
program will be running Android.</p>
