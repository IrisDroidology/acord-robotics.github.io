While all of that had been going on, the Chancellor of the New Earth project, Logan Owen, had been overseeing the crop growth. Sitting down, he started to count the potato plants, writing the Talley into a little notepad.

Owen was one of the only members on board the space stations that did not use technology - at least, not much of it. He still preferred to use pen and paper, and he only used computers for calculations to complicated for most humans to comprehend. Highly unusual, he had risen through the ranks to become the highest-paid cosmonaut ever, earning over $2 million universal credits (the worldwide currency) in the last year of the Earth being habitable.
