â€‹While in Albany I was able to get my iPod repaired for $78 at Pro Phone Repairs. In part 2 you will be able to see some photos of the iPod, be4 and after.
Pro Phone Repairs has a good warranty service and a much cheaper repair price than Apple, and if you are down near Albany I would highly recommend this service.
