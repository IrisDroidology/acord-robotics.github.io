<p style="text-align: justify;">When you register on this site, you will be able to choose what department you want to work in. You get to be in a department when you get to the Silver Pin Rank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are already a member but have not yet registered, you can automatically go into your department of YOUR choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other things you have to say when you sign up include:</p>

<ol>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Name</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Username</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Password</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Have you been a member before?</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">What department?</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Do you know any other members?</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Age</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Country</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Language</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Job/School Grade (depends on if you are in school or at work)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You must answer these truthfully so we can put you into the department that you would like. To help put you with people of your own expertise/age, we ask about your job and age. You may not get into your first choice of department, but the good thing is you will be chosen for a department that WE think suits you. If you think that you want to be in a different department, please contact us.</p>
