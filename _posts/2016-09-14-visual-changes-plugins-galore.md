<p style="text-align: justify;">I have been wanting to change the site visually for ages. Finally, with the Make theme, that dream has become a reality. By using the theme along with custom plug-ins, I can create a unique, functional WordPress theme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few changes, which I will go through one at a time:</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Main Menu Change</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main changes is that the main menu is now at the very top of the site, with the Home, Shop &amp; Forum links there, and for non-logged-in users, the sign-up &amp; log-in buttons are also included.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Member &amp; Post Menu Change</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Member Menu is now located under the green header, with our archives on the sidebar. Our categories are also on the sidebar. To see the droids, click on the button that says Droids in the top right.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">CHAT</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lot of people have been wanting a chat system. It should be up &amp; running in a few days. The system is called iFlyChat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks everyone!</p>
