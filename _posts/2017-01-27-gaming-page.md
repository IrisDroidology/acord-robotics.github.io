â€‹Gaming is a big part of my life, and I want to show that off on this website. I generally play Minecraft, Fifa16, Space Engineers, and various other games. Go to http://allianceofdroids.org.au/portfolio/gaming/ to see my gaming page.

My first "device" was my iPod 5G, which I got when I turned 10. But I gamed even before that. One of my earliest computer memories is on the plane with my dad when we were going to Norway back in 2007 (I think there were 2 or 3 flights in that trip, each way, plus a flight to and from Scotland), and we were playing a sort of maze game, and we had almost completed it when the computers were turned off because we were coming in to land.&nbsp;

At home I played two main games: Whinnie The Pooh (math and reading), and Star Wars Math (Jabba's game galaxy). I want to talk about the Star Wars game, though.

There were 4 or 5 different mini-games in the actual game, as well as the spaceship game and building your spaceship parts. I was scared of Jabba in the chess game, Djerak (back in 1999, graphics on Jabba were scary to a six-year-old). There was also the dice game with Sebulba. You got to build your own ship.

After I got my iPod, I played Gizmonauts, &nbsp;Minecraft, Jetpack Joyride, and other games like those ones.

You can expect to see photos and short clips from Minecraft, Force Collection, Fifa16, Lego Star Wars TFA, and more will be revealed.
