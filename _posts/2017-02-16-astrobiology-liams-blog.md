<h1 style="text-align: center;">ASTROBIOLOGY POST</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Astrobiology is my passion, science is my dream. This is the motto that I have lived with since I was 11. I first got into Astrobiology when I was bored during class and I searched up something to do with Martian life (see my earlier blog postsÂ <a href="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/blog/2017/02/10/liams-blog-life-on-mars-part-3/" target="_blank">here</a>). I was instantly hooked onto the subject and have been ever since.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, things have gotten in the way, notably school work, the AoD, and bullying has hindered rather than helped this interest of mine. But I am planning to make this a priority in my life as a blogger, and Astrobiology will be a common topic on this blog series.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">WHAT IS ASTROBIOLOGY?</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Astrobiology is a type of science that looks at how life originates/originated, if there is/was life outside of the Earth (either before or now), and places where humans could live.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Astrobiology is technically a new type of science, but going back many hundreds of years there are people - philosophers - that have talked about life off of the Earth. For example, Galileo toyed with the idea of life on Jupiter's moons.</span></p>
