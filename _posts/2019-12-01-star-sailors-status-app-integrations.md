<h2>+ Star Sailors 1.E - Chapter 6 Sneak Peak</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Citizens of the universe, welcome back to the Senate. Can everyone please stay in their assigned pods for the duration of this meeting."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayin's voice boomed out from the center of a small chamber. There were little honeycombs around this chamber, with small models of pods situated around the area, creating an illusion that everyone was there. Everyone was situated on differing asteroids, with this being both a security measure and a way to ensure maximum efficiency for all the Senators and their aides (and occasionally the governors of the planets, who were the ones who nominated their Senators). What had been discovered was that when there were millions of people in one room, with thousands of Senators, things tended to get a bit messy and chaotic. To solve this, everyone was in their own room on their own Asteroid, which was artificial spaceships designed to look like asteroids; they could be piloted up and down to the surface of Midgard.&nbsp;<em>"It makes sense now,"&nbsp;</em>Gilbert thought.&nbsp;<em>"I don't understand why we didn't have this system back on Earth."&nbsp;</em>He had also been wondering about the stability of such a set-up, with many thousands of asteroids in orbit around a planet so close to a large moon (about 10% of the area above Midgard was uncovered by satellites, and another 5% was only covered by research satellites).&nbsp;<em>"So the moon is actually a hollowed-out planet that was nudged into orbit around this planet - Midgard - and that's where the asteroids stay until the Parliament/Senate is in session."&nbsp;</em>He'd heard it be called the Parliament and he'd heard it be called the Senate. Regardless, he was here now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He looked to his right and saw one of the Keplernian Greys next to him. Seeing that he wanted to say something, he unplugged the earpiece he'd been using to listen to the audio feed that Jayin had given him, which was describing the political system.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"My friend, we're glad to have you with usss." The grey spoke with a lisp and strongly exaggerated his "s" sounds. "There are many Keplernians, with each species in the Keplernian family being nominated as a Senator from their home planet. For example, I've been nominated by the Governor of Kepler-22 and ticked off by Jayin." His eyes fluttered when he said this, and he looked around the Honeycomb in what Gilbert assumed was a look of excitement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I thought there was one senator for each world, and they each had their own pod?" Gilbert was confused. Wasn't that how it had worked in Star Wars?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Ah, yes, you've watched too much Star Wars. Plenty of factual inaccuracies, but it did get a lot of things right" The grey did like to demonstrate his mind-reading capability, but at that moment an alien with green head-tails ("lekku") walked past. The grey watched Gilbert's eyes be drawn towards the Green. "That's Kfit. He's from Kepler Glee."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"<em>Is this some kind of SW fantasy?"</em>&nbsp;Gilbert asked himself, not for the first time. How much had George Lucas gotten right? He knew that Opus would love to hear all about this, and Gilbert (once again) promised himself that he'd rescue Opus from the mess that he'd gotten himself into. "So what about the pods?"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Ah yes," the grey answered, stroking his chin-whiskers thoughtfully. "So each species family, for example, us Keplernians, is related to each other. Every Keplernian is related closely, we have similar genetic code. We have a small amount of DNA which is very close to identical to yours. Deoxyribonucleic acid is found in all life forms, even microbes - your scientists got that one wrong." He chuckled and continued - "but they did get something right. They found RNA, and mRNA, which is what some of us Keplernians, including myself, are 'coded" from. So each species family has a pod. Every planet that houses a species from that family is sent to a pod, so you, and I, and Kfit, were sent to this pod by Jayin and our Planetary Governor. After this, Jayin nominates a "lead" Senator from this family, who will act as a "mini-chancellor" within our pod. This means that there are millions of Senators, and many of these share a hive mind (well, we all do, but to differing effects and efficiency).&nbsp; This is how our senate works."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A hush fell over the room, and the lights dimmed - it seemed like the eyes were one of the major sensory organs of most intelligent creatures around the universe.&nbsp;<em>"Back home, huge amounts of animals were nocturnal and didn't use their eyes. We couldn't live without them - is this important in the evolution of intelligent life?"&nbsp;</em>Gilbert thought as he pondered this. He'd always been interested in biology and had frequently gone to the library on Earth and read all about Charles Darwin &amp; Richard Dawkins before they left their planet.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kfit, the alien with the head tentacles, or head-tails, spoke up. "Can we Keplernians please welcome Grekzil, the Keplernian Senator, to the pod." Gilbert looked around and saw the blue-skinned alien, Starrix, but there was no-one else that he saw. Starrix waved to him, and Gilbert wondered where Grekzil - and who Grekzil - was. He pulled out the datapad that had been given to him by Jayin - the one that had been reading him the audio feed - and tapped through the database. He found that Grekzil was the Grey he'd been talking to. "Starrix Lierge, Miydlian Fleet Commander, is here for security. Also, please now welcome the aides for each Keplernian senator - Alek Vicheva, please come through."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The doors to their pod hissed open. Before, they were opaque and with a crystal texture. As soon as they started opening, the colour became transparent and you could see who was coming through the opening before the door had fully opened. A tall - like 7 foot tall - man with brown hair came walking through. Of course, this was Alek, but Gilbert had had no idea that he'd have an aide, let alone that it would be Alek. He stood at his console, not knowing what to do as Alek came over to him. They said their hellos and then Gilbert sat back down as the other Senators mingled with their aides. Some of them were with 3 or 4, but Gilbert only had Alek.&nbsp;<em>"That's fine,"&nbsp;</em>he thought to himself. He'd always only hung out with one person - Opus - on the ship, and unless he was by himself, he didn't suffer from loneliness. Besides, there was so much interesting stuff to look at to take his mind off his isolation, and the other Keplernians were paying him so much attention, with so much awe, that he just put himself in the moment and thought about his job as Senator. Senator of Earth - who could have imagined that!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The console in the center of the room - the pod - flickered to life, and a hologram of Jayin appeared. The colour started off in the blueish colour like in Star Wars &amp; Star Trek, before fading to become a white design with coloured patches. Jayin's image was so well-focused that the warts and wrinkles were perfectly defined in the image. The holoprojector rotated around the console so that each of the Senators could see the face of their Chancellor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Greetings, Senate. May the 136,057th Senate meeting now commence." On-screen, he settled into his chair and pulled out his datapad, and as he did this Gilbert saw an opportunity to ask something to Kfit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"How long has the Senate been around for?" he asked, curious. He'd always been a student of history and devoured books about topics - both fiction and non-fiction - about this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The Senate?&nbsp; Less than 10000 years. But there's been many thousands of iterations around the universe and the galaxy, and each galaxy in the universe is in a state of peace. We're all related to each other - every particle is - through something called the Siri particle - well, that's what your scientists would call it. This binds the universe together, like midichlorians, and is part of the reason why there have been many states of peace in our history. I'd say there has been peace in the galaxy for over a billion years, and colonization - and life - started shortly after the Big Bang, thanks in part to our "midichlorians" that were around at the start of everything."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While he pondered this, Jayin spoke again. "We have picked up a new group of interlopers that have gratefully joined our Senate. These are the citizens from a planet called Earth, which was recently destroyed. This is what we discussed last time. I suggest we call for a vote for mobilization of a navy to track down what happened to Earth, and the other planets like this."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The real question is Chancellor, why Earth was taken in the first place. I think that this speaks volumes about the inept commanders that our navy has, the navy that was put into place to keep us safe and to prevent things like this happening!" boomed the senator from Rastreon, Or Freeta, one of the senators who had been there the longest. "There's no point trying to retrieve this planet when more planets can - and will - be taken. We need to focus on prevention! Which world would go next? Kepler? Rastreon? Or even Midgard! The action you're suggesting taking will drag this republic into destruction!" he finished, with applause coming from all corners of the chamber.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Perhaps the good senator from Rastreon makes a point there," Jayin began, "however we have newcomers to the Senate that have lost their planet. Now is not the time for this discussion."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"If not now, then when, Chancellor?" Xats Avith asked. "You claim that creating a galaxy-wide military is only supported in the Outer Reaches because it would bring wealth and riches to our world. I think you forget that it exploits our worlds as well. We were selected as Senators by you, with you stating that you believed we would put the interests of our people, our worlds and the republic first, before riches and bribes. So if we ask for a military, surely we are not looking our for ourselves and are trying to help! If we are trying to exploit our worlds, then it is you that needs to be removed, because obviously you cannot decide who deserves to be in this Senate Rotunda!"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chaos reigned. Around Midgard, senators on their asteroids pressed the buttons on their consoles and shouted in their native languages, either supporting or shooting down this demand. Pandemonium reigned, and eventually, Jayin just gave up on calling "Order!" and let the chaos reign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>---</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They filed out of their asteroid onto a cruiser ship. All of them sat around the edges of the ship, strapped in for the wild ride towards the surface of Midgard. Another console lay in the middle of their area, and right now it was showing a replay of the events that had occurred in the Senate that day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>"Wow,"&nbsp;</em>Gilbert thought.&nbsp;<em>"Was I really a part of that?"</em>&nbsp;In that 3-hour session, he'd been introduced and had discussed his homeworld. Many of the Senators swooned with happy memories when he told them about Earth's beautiful landscapes - the most populous planets in the Midgard Republic had very few natural landscapes left - all native life had been moved to small zoos, a kind of cosmic Ark. The sole exception was Midgard, which orbited a triple-star system (Yellow G-Type, a Blue O-Type and a Red M-Type). This gave them a lot of variety, with the flares from the red dwarf and the electromagnetic pulses from the blue supergiant leading to beautiful auroras, some of which looked exactly like the ones on Earth - but they occurred all around the planet. The planet was laid out in skyscrapers that went deep into the ground, with flora and fauna almost "taking over" the entire community. It was a paradise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ship landed on a pad marked with a strange symbol, but in Gilbert's eyes it quickly rearranged into the shape of a "K.E". For Starrix, the symbol changed to a squiggly line.&nbsp;<em>"How many people in this area have implants?"</em>&nbsp;Gilbert wondered. Where he was from, implants were reserved for combat, and very few people - traditionally commanders - had them inserted permanently. It seemed here that everyone had a variety of implants, and he must have them as well. But when did they plant them inside him? He's been conscious since the beginning of this adventure...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The realization of when it occurred came quickly after this thought. They'd given him a drug, and that drug had put him into a different state of consciousness.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a second, he was furious. How dare these people to implant something inside him - his body was his temple - how dare these people - these things - invade his privacy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he realized something, something that had been theorized by many Earth theorists - Musk, Hawking, Cox, Head-Gordon - of the past - these aliens had different values and opinions to his people. For the Keplernians, who had lived with these implants (probably) for generations, it was just as common as something like a custom organ (for example a pacemaker heart). Furthermore, he had been taken care of thanks to those implants. Without having been put into that state, he probably would have been shot down in the fight with the pirates.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"You really think that you could sstand againsst usss?" The thing that had smacked him in the face pulled him to his feet. He applied pressure to Opus's wrist and he dropped the sharp bit of rubble that he had been holding. "And more to the pointssss, why would you attack usss?"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opus looked quickly around, but there was only one creature. He'd thought there were 2, but only one was on the ship, standing in the pile of rubble. He rubbed his eyes. He must have been dreaming before; he'd heard - and seen - 2 alien creatures arguing - or discussing - something, maybe him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Our name is Si Tremba, we are the Arcanons." The alien came into Opus's focus, and he realised that the alien had a triangular-shaped head. "We are one single hive mind."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly, Si's eyes flashed from black to yellow. "And we are the Babd." The yellow eyes switched to red. "And we are the Morrigan".&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Wh-what happend to Earth?" Opus wasn't usually a stutterer, and silently he chided himself. When you stuttered, you weren't in control, and this was a situation he needed to remain in control of. If there was a chance to save his home, he needed to be in control.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Morrigan laughed, a loud laugh that sounded similar to the cackle of a crow. "See, he feels a relationship to his world!" she - or he, Opus couldn't tell -&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>---</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Infiniraid, Opus controls dragalien, sends message, Arconans are created via imagination, etcÂ </p>
