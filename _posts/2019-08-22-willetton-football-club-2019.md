<p>Willetton's had a successful season this year. After finishing 6th with 4 wins, 8 losses in 2018, Willetton finished 3rd after the H&amp;A season, with 10 wins and 3 losses. I want to discuss this awesome season in this post, as well as what will be happening in the finals. We won our first ever final against Kingsway last week, and we play Coolbinia this weekend for a place in the Grand Final. It's been a terrific season, so let's get right into this post!</p>

<h2>Home &amp; Away Season</h2>

<h4>The Off-Season</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Expectations were low, but optimism was high for Willetton heading into  the 2019 season. We picked up some genuine A-graders - Tyson Worthington  &amp; Trent Fleming. We lost no players to other teams, and we were a  more experienced outfit than the team that had taken to the field in  2018.                          </p>

<p><strong>Round 1 - Kingsway vs Willetton - First Game (W)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> We had a strong start to our 2019 campaign, after defeating the reigning  minor premiers by 33 points in Round 1 at Kingsway Reserve. It was a  really good match for us - we held Kingsway to only 3 goals (they were  the highest scoring team last season) while scoring 9 ourselves. I  wanted us to play a very defensive style of footy, which limited our  goal opportunities, however it limited Kingsway's as well. Our best  players were put behind the ball - in the midfield and the defensive 50 -  for the first 3 quarters before the floodgates were opened. We recorded  78 marks in the first 3 quarters, most of those coming from short,  15-20 meter kicks. We gradually made our way forward, kicking 5 goals to  3 in those first 3 quarters. Trent Fleming, Aaron Richardson &amp;  Tyson Worthington played their first matches for Willetton (Fleming  &amp; Richardson had come from CBC Green in the off-season)                          </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Round 2 - Willetton vs High Wycombe - First Home Game (L)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> We crashed back down to earth with a 16 point defeat to High Wycombe. I  kicked 3 goals in the defeat. We played as a team, and our (now)  trademark run-and-carry was seen often. However, we went back into our  shells a bit, and we made plenty of mistakes after that. I thought,  however, that if we played with that running, handball happy approach  for the whole game, we would have no problem beating High Wycombe the  next time we played them (and that was proven correct, in Round 12 at  Steel Blue Oval).           </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Round 3 - Willetton vs Wembley - Topping the ton (W)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> We topped the ton (scoring 100+ points) for the first time of the season  against Wembley. I kicked a goal and we won by over 80 points, however  as I walked off the pitch I was disappointed because we could have won  by more. So was our coach, Keilan, who told us to believe in our abiliy  to run with the ball. He told us that our greatest asset was our speed -  so use it! It would take another fortnight before that happened.                          </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Round 4 - Willetton vs Coolbinia - Gunned down by the falcons (L)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Our 3rd home match in a row ended in defeat to Coolbinia. It was a  horror loss marred with shocking kicked by both teams. On a positive  note, however, Ashley North played a good debut game and kicked a goal  from the pocket. It was our last loss until Round 11 against Kingsway               </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Round 5 - Warnbro vs Willetton - Running away with the win (W)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Winning against Warnbro was probably one of the most important wins in  our history. It finally displayed our speed, our run through the middle,  and our ability to cut through the oppositiions' midfields like butter.  We took on Warnbro, who were a much improved side from last year, but  they were ultimately outclassed. I kicked 2 goals and finally felt like  we were on the right track                          </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Round 6 - North Beach vs Willetton - Rain, hail or snow (W)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> In the wet, the cold, and the mud (not to mention the hail), we thrashed  North Beach. Our run and carry was hampered by the rain, but we still  cut North Beach to pieces. I kicked 2 goals.                          </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Round 7 - Willetton vs CBC Gold - The wall of Blue (W)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> We held CBC Gold to only 6 points (1.0.6) while scoring 109 points  ourselves. I kicked 2 goals in the last quarter, after 2 marks from  pinpoint Tyson Worthington kicks. Every time we entered inside the 50,  our midfielders and defenders built up a wall along the perimeter of the  50 meter arc. Every time CBC's defenders tried to boot it out, we were  there to send it back in. Our run and carry was not really on show here  either, but we had no need for it, with over 60% of the match being  played in our forward 50 meters.                          </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Round 8 - Willetton vs Coolbinia - The Game of the Year (W)</strong>                                </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> We played at Steel Blue Oval against the Falcons for the 2019 WAFL  Count-Me-In Round. It was an all-round thriller, with Willetton  eventually triumphing 4.5.29 to 4.2.26 (3 points). We conceded 2 goals  in the first quarter, but after that our run and carry took over and we  held them goalless until the final minutes of the game. We kicked no  goals until towards the end of the third quarter, and Uwane (Akor)  kicked what we thought was the sealer with about 4 minutes remaining,  putting us up 23 to 14. But Coolbinia drew one back, before a midfield  error handed the ball straight to Uwane again, he capitalised on the  chance with delight and slotted his second, putting us up by 9. We  chipped the ball around for a little bit, before an illegal block on a  Coolbinia player gave them a shot from outside 50. A dubious 50 meter  penalty bought that kick to within 15 meters, and he duly converted.  Luckily, we held on for an epic win.                          </p>

<p><strong>Round 9 - Mandurah vs Willetton - Down the highway (W)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> The league newcomers, Mandurah (Mustangs), took on Willetton down in  Mandurah. We were up by 50 at 3 quarter time - our run and carry was  really, really good in that second quarter - when Keilan gave Mandurah  some of our players to try and stem the flow. It was a kind gesture,  reminding us of last year when Willetton only had 12 players (Mandurah  has 11). We won 68 to 28, but there are bright signs for Mandurah's  future! I kicked 3 goals.                          </p>

<p><strong>Round 10 - Willetton vs CBC Green - Securing our finals spot (W)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> I'd done my  duty for the club. I'd done the maths - my duty - and I had  confirmed that by beating CBC Green at home, we would secure our top 4  spot (we currently have a top 5 spot, but that wasn't confirmed until  the end of the season. I'd done my maths on the basis of the top-4  system.). We had a comprehensive win against Trent's old team, but he,  Tyson, Tyler (Gould) and Geoff (Stewart) (C) missed the match because  they were on state duty. I kicked 3 goals for the second week in a row  and our midfield cut them to shreds.       </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Round 11 - Willetton vs Kingsway - Injuries and missing players take their toll (L)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Our first loss in 7 games occured against Kingsway in Round 11. I kicked  our first goal, but it was all Kingsway, who were ultimately the better  team on the day. The state players were still away, and we ultimately  made too many mistakes and didn't put our heads over the ball. We had  already secured our finals spot, but this one hurt. <strong>Really bad.</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Round 12 - High Wycombe vs Willetton - Ending our hoodoo (W)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> In Willetton's second integrated match - in 2017 - we played High  Wycombe at Steel Blue for the WAFL Count Me In Round. I kicked a few  goals in that game, and we won. However, that was before we had joined  the Integrated League (WAAIFL), and we had never beaten High Wycombe in  the league. But our run and carry tired them our in the second half. We  were separated by only 3 points at 3 quarter time, but we had been the  better team in the second quarter, and our running was too much for High  Wycombe's players, who crumbled due to lack of match fitness in that  last quarter. We kicked 7 goals to 1 in that last quarter, however Zac  Broxton fractured his eye socket in a clash with a High Wycombe player  in the last 2 minutes, and he was ruled out for the remainder of the  season.                          </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Round 13 - Willetton vs North Beach - One last game (W)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Our final game of the home and away season ended with a 100 point win  against North Beach. I kicked 1 goal and set up a few others, as we  boosted our confidence ahead of an important clash with Kingsway.                          </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Qualifying FInal - Kingsway vs Willetton - First finals win!</strong> (W)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> It was a big game. Willetton's first ever final was against Kingsway,  the only team that had defeated us after Round 4. We were very evenly  matched throughout the first 3 quarters, however we broke loose in the  last quarter. I kicked 2 goals, including 1 from outside the 50 meter  arc, to secure the win.                                            </p>
