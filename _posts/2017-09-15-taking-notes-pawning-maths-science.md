Maths &amp; Science is becoming ever easier for me. We have just started a new human bio course in science, and although it has almost nothing to do with my dreams and ambitions (at the moment), it is very interesting and I am very eager to do well in it.

In maths, we are doing probability (I got 94% on my last test) and plots (<strong>histograms, box &amp; whisker plots</strong>, etc). It is really fun, and I really enjoy being able to be incredibly good.

Using KhanAcademy.org I can easily do my human bio stuff.

Anyway, I need to do some more work now, however I will be back on the site soon.
