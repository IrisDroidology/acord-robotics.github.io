One of the greatest mysteries is about life outside of Earth. Scientists still donâ€™t know if there is alien life, but could there be? Could manâ€™s greatest mystery be solved?

Years ago, centuries ago in fact, almost everyone believed that the Sun, and all the other planets, went around the Earth. Thanks to spacecraft and scientific tools, we now know that it is in fact the other way around. But this shows that what the majority believes is correct may not be correct.

The Catholic Church encouraged the Geocentric theory â€“ that is, the Earth is the centre of everything and everything orbits it. This was because the Church wanted to <em>prove </em>the Bible right â€“ the Bible said that the Earth was the most important part of the universe, which is why we are here. The Church obviously thought that nothing could be important if not at the centre.

The Church also treated scientists with a different idea very harshly. Ignoring Galileo for a minute, letâ€™s look at one of the lesser-known scientists, Giordano Bruno, an Italian in the 16<sup>th</sup> Century, who was burned at the stake for this quote:

<em>There are countless suns and countless earths all rotating round their suns in exactly the same way as the seven planets of our system. We see only the suns because they are the largest bodies and are luminous, but their planets remain invisible to us because they are smaller and non-luminous. The countless worlds in the universe are no worse and no less inhabited than our earth. For it is utterly unreasonable to suppose that those teeming worlds which are as magnificent as our own, perhaps more so, and which enjoy the fructifying rays of a sun just as we do, should be uninhabited and should not bear similar or even more perfect inhabitants than our earth.</em>

Unfortunately, Bruno was burnt at the stake in 1600 for his â€˜heresy,â€™ and Galileo Galilei was put under house arrest for his heretical views as well.

This is important to know so you can truly appreciate why we still are in the Dark Ages in the search for E.T, and maybe if we didnâ€™t have the Church practically forcing us to do things back then, we would probably already have found some inkling of E.T.

Science has come a long way since then, but we are still nowhere near being able to hop into a spaceship and just fly to another planet where there is life, even if it inside the solar system. If it is outside our solar system, it could take thousands of years to get to them â€“ and that is at the speed of light.

Now, all we can do to find traces of life off the Earth is to look through telescopes and computers to see if we can see traces of elements, compounds and organic materials that are used by life as we know it on Earth. For example, we on Earth are Carbon-Based life, and we mostly live in the same temperature range. But there are so-called extremophiles, which can exist in extreme conditions, for example extremely cold or hot, or extremely acidic conditions. But, mostly these organisms are bacterium or very, very small creatures, but the fact is they <em>can</em> exist.

This could help us understand about how we can find life on other planets. I strongly believe that life exists outside of Earth, and maybe even INTELLIGENT life. But I know that there is almost definitely some sort of bacterium out there.

In 2001, there was a book published, Rare Earth, that talked about how we are almost certainly the only intelligent species in the UNIVERSE. The authors of this book where devout Christians, and I have already explained how the Bible states that God made us the only intelligent species, and the Earth is the only habitable planet.

This book is completely based on half-truths and outright lies to continue to give credit to the Church. I mean, the ORIGINAL bible said that the Earth is only 6,000 years old, which we know is NOT true. The <strong>b</strong>ible is written to make us sound like the most important species, because God created us.

Religion should not get in the way of science. It has held us back centuries, because the Church was in charge of pretty much everything in the 1100s-1600s, and anything â€“ anyone - that <em>could </em>prove the bible wrong had to be dealt with.

Galileo was prosecuted because he said that the Earth was not the centre of the Universe. Surely, the Church argued, if God made us the most important things in the universe, we must be at the centre.

Now letâ€™s get back to the topic of E.T. Featured in countless movies and novels, aliens are either your nightmare or your favourite thing to debate.

It has not rained on Mars for 3 billion years. But how could it have rained and maybe even had life, if there is no life there today? Well, my theory is that when the Sun was young and in its infancy, it didnâ€™t give off as much radiation and energy as it does now. This means that, although Mars has a very low mass compared to Earth, it was able to hold onto its atmosphere until the Sunâ€™s radiation was strong enough to break it apart, separating the various parts of the atmosphere and scattering it out into space.

Another notable tool in the search for E.T. is the <em>Drake Equation</em>. Formulated by Frank Drake (1930-present), it is an equation (obviously) that helps give an idea of how frequent life is in our galaxy. By looking at the amount of planets and stars in the various galaxies, it can see how frequent planets that are at the right distance from their parent star could exist, and then even find their composition.

We are all made of Star Dust. Without stars dying, we would not exist. This is because in the starsâ€™ bellies, they fuse Hydrogen to Helium, and then when that is all used up they may be massive enough to fuse Helium to Carbon, and all the way up to Iron. Iron is the breaking point for most stars, because nuclear stellar fusion cannot fuse anything further than Iron. Remember, the composition of the Universe when it was first <em>born </em>was about 99.999% hydrogen &amp; helium, with very small traces of lithium and beryllium. But after super-massive stars explode in a SUPERNOVA, the temperature can reach up to 5 billion degrees Celsius. This means they can fuse all the way up to the most massive elements. The more massive a star, the higher the temperatures in its core can be, so the further they can fuse up the periodic table.

And then look at exoplanets â€“ planets outside our solar system. There are thousands of candidates (Kepler Space Telescope â€“ KST) and thousands of confirmed planets, with almost 50 in the habitable â€“ Goldilocks â€“ zone of their star, where liquid water can exist, and about the same size as the Earth.

This means that there could be hundreds, thousands, millions of planets in the universe that are habitable â€“ and that is for life as we know it. What about all the other types of life that could exist â€“ for example, on Titan (Saturnâ€™s largest moon, which is one of the most likely heavenly bodies to have life), any life there would be Nitrogen-based, with a liquid water ocean underneath the surface. AND there are also chances of moons and planets being able to have water underneath their surfaces, where it would be warmer than the surface.

Scientists can know all this, but it takes someone special to find aliens. Could it be you, me, our someone else? Time will tell.
