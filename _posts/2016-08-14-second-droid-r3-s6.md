Our first droid, Sp-D2, was built in Victoria, Australia. We made him with a Steampunk theme.

Ian Arbuckle &amp; myself made him in January 2016.

For our next droid we would like to have it able to move by itself and also be based off the droid R3-S6, from The Clone Wars.

We are going to be updating the paint scheme and using my iPod 5G as the control panel. Using an application known as R2-Touch, we will be able to control a large amount of droid functions.

We have a full list of parts that we will list here. The prices are in Aussie Dollars. Total price is $3100 (approximately).

Thanks for everyone's support!

<p style="text-align: justify;">This droid will be able to be outfitted with different skins to celebrate/raise awareness about different disabilities/people. We are going to have one with the French Flag to commemorate the Nice attack earlier this year and a rainbow skin to celebrate Gay Pride.</p>
