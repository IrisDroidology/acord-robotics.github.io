By disabling WPTouchPRO on the Wordpress Dashboard, the mobile app/layout no longer looks so ugly. However, this comes with some flaws:
<ul>
	<li>Before, you could add our site to your home screen and it would act like an app, so it wouldn't go into your browser</li>
	<li>Now you can't do that as I have deactivated it (unless I get a new theme for WPTouchPRO, it will stay this way).</li>
	<li>However, if you have already downloaded the app, you can still use it, and it will still act like before: it just will use the regular Thrive layout (by Dunhakadis)</li>
	<li>If you want to have the app installed, send me a private message at <a href="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/droidlings/droidologyiris/">http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/droidlings/droidologyiris/</a><a href="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/droidlings/droidologyiris/">http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/droidlings/droidologyiris/</a></li>
</ul>
