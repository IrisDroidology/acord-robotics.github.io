<p style="text-align: justify"><h1>LAST TIMEâ€¦
</h1></p><p style="text-align: justify">In the last post, I talked about the bullying that I have been through in my life. I talked about how I coped with it, and why I think it happened. Today I am going to be talking about my relationships with my family â€“ my twin sister, and my parents.
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><h1>My family â€“ Brief Overview
</h1></p><p style="text-align: justify">I have a twin sister, two parents, a dog, and two budgies. My dad is also autistic, and I believe my sister also displays traits of autism. My dad and I don't usually get along, but I am used to it now and I sort of believe that it is normal for us to just not get along. Of course that doesn't mean that I hate him, but we are so different. I don't believe that it would be very easy for him either. 
</p><p style="text-align: justify">My mum is a different matter entirely. She does have her moments â€“ and she can be a lot worse than dad â€“ but she is a lot easier to talk to and seems to accept me for who I am â€“ more than Dad does anyway. 
</p><p style="text-align: justify">As much as I would love to say my sister and I get along incredibly well, the truth is that we don't. Far from it. She is prone to MASSIVE mood swings, and she is happy one second, and then nothing happens but she gets completely crazy. Our relationship has been getting better slightly, but it still doesn't take much for it to go over the edge, which I will explain in the chapter about my sister.
</p><p style="text-align: justify">My dog, Elsie, is an Australian Terrier. While I know that dogs don't speak English, I do believe that she can understand complex emotions. I know this because whenever I am feeling upset, even if I don't cry, she comes up to me. 
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The two birds in the family belong to my sister, although we do share a special bond after I saved Rio from the great, wild dog. 
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><h1>Dad â€“ The one who knows how I feel
</h1></p><p style="text-align: justify">I think that I love dad more than anyone else in the family, because I know the struggles that he went through when he was my age, better than anyone else. I may not get along with him, but he and I share a special bond because I can always come to him after something happens that may have triggered my AS. 
</p><p style="text-align: justify">As long as I am talking to dad about something to do with science, math, cars, bikes, (some) games and good grades, we can maintain a good relationship. 
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Dad rides his bike every day to work, which is about 25 kilometres away from our home, in the city. He is one of the fittest men I know, especially since he was able to do a 190 kilometre ride a couple of years ago. I love riding my bike as well, which is an absolutely enormous bike that requires frequent maintenance. We also like to talk about cars, as that is one of his passions â€“ but I get bored pretty easily watching car races so I thought of a compromise â€“ I would get the game Forza Motorsport 5 for my xBox and play it with him instead.
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Dad is one of the best people at maths that I know, so when I have math homework I usually sit down with him on the weekends. It is pretty hard to work with him sometimes, considering he likes to take me above and beyond the usual stuff â€“ even though at my school, the usual stuff in year 8 is like year 9 stuff for other schools.

</p><p style="text-align: justify"><h1>Mum â€“ the helpfulness queen 
</h1></p><p style="text-align: justify">Mum is a lot more of an enigma than dad. She can be really happy one minute and then get completely crappy the next, mainly because of something that is out of place or something that happens to her, which sets her off for most of the day. This post isn't supposed to be about how much I love my mum; it is about the relationship between us. So I am not going to be sugar-coating her.
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><h2>When we get along:
</h2></p><p style="text-align: justify">We get along quite well when she has had time to do her crochet and not have had to do much house work. She likes talking to me about my day, and recently she has been quite excited about the project I am embarking on. She likes it when I am busy crocheting with her, but I don't find it very fun and I only do it to keep her in a good mood.
</p><p style="text-align: justify">She admits that she doesn't know much â€“ anything â€“ about math or science, so she really isn't a very big help with my homework in those subjects. She can help with Humanities, English, and some other less-technical subjects.
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><h2>Why we don't get along:
</h2></p><p style="text-align: justify">The reason we usually don't get along is because she likes everything to be organised and she hates my room when it isn't up to her standard. She often exaggerates about my room, like saying that she had to take everything out of the cupboards because she couldn't <em>walk </em>inside it. That sort of defeats the purpose, doesn't it? She took everything out because she couldn't walk inside my room, and then she <em>can?</em> She says stuff about how I <em>had to have</em> this or that, when she <em>conveniently </em>forgets that she bought it for my birthday AND I didn't ask for it, or I actually <em>do </em>need it and I bought it â€“ she didn't. I believe that I am responsible for the things that I buy and I shouldn't have to go through this when she says I <em>can </em>buy it. 
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Mum changes her mind so much, it is incredibly hard to keep up with her.

Â </p><p style="text-align: justify"><h1>Carly â€“ My sister
</h1></p><p style="text-align: justify">Carly is pretty much just like mum, just a younger version. The relationships between myself and my sister &amp; myself and my mum are almost identical except for the fact that mum is a lot less moody (most of the time) and is slightly more predictable.
