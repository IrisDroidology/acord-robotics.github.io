<p style="text-align: justify"><h1>What are Member Badges?
</h1></p><p style="text-align: justify">Member Badges are a perk we award members with for their specific achievements, roles, and loyalty. You can see your list of badges in your profile (when we get it set up), and also buy the badges from our shop. Everyone is eligible for badges, and they are part of our MEMBER PERKS program.
</p><h2>Member Perks â€“ A brief guide
</h2><p style="text-align: justify">I would not encourage you to just read this guide on the perks, because there is so much more information that I am forced to leave out of this guide. Basically member perks are ways of saying thanks to our members, like the badges. But there is more to it than just badges. We have invitations to conferences and parties, technology, droids, and other stuff that are awarded to you through your prestige. 
</p><p style="text-align: justify">We give each member (who wants one) a small notebook that can record their history/prestige. When they have successfully completed a 'mission', they can get the perk associated with it.
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><h1>Department Badges
</h1></p><p style="text-align: justify">All our members probably know that there are various Alliance Departments:
</p><ul><li><div style="text-align: justify">Science
</div></li><li><div style="text-align: justify">Gaming
</div></li><li><div style="text-align: justify">Gay Pride
</div></li><li><div style="text-align: justify">Writing/Yearbook
</div></li><li><div style="text-align: justify">Droids
</div></li><li><div style="text-align: justify">DroidsCouncil
</div></li><li><div style="text-align: justify">Media 
</div></li><li><div style="text-align: justify">Member Perks
</div></li></ul><p style="text-align: justify">You can get badges when you join these departments. This will be explained below.
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><h2>Department Members
</h2></p><p style="text-align: justify">When you first join a department, you are officially a member. You get access to specific information to do with that department, but some more <em>juicy</em> content may require you to be a specialist. Members are made to have relatively low privileges, not because we don't trust them, but because we want to see how they settle into the department.
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Members are able to go to the specific department's conferences, but have limited power. 
</p><p style="text-align: justify">You may not get to be a specialist, but the Department Specialists record your progress, and over time, you may get more privileges.
</p><h2>Department Specialists
</h2><p style="text-align: justify">When you do a great service to the department, you may be elevated to Specialist. Specialists are able to organise experiments (science dept. example), co-ordinate the yearbook (writing dept. example), and so on. They get a special gem stone and a member card/badge that shows their status. It also goes into their ID Book. 
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><h1>Other Badges
</h1></p><p style="text-align: justify">When you become a member of the Alliance, you get the special INDUCTEE pin. This is a pin with our logo on it. It is $5 â€“ most of the badges cost money. 
</p><p style="text-align: justify">You also get badges for your time with the Alliance of Droids, and your anniversaries. You get a gold pin every year you are a member.</p>
