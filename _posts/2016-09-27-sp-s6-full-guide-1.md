<h2></h2>
<h2>Who is Sp-S6?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sp-S6 is a hypothetical character, basically our remake of Sp-D2. Sp-D2 was built in January 2016, and we are planning to remake him into Sp-S6, a fully functional Steampunk Astromech.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">What are these updates about?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These updates are going to be about our transformation of Sp-D2 into Sp-S6. We will be giving a full guide, tutorial, and links to various websites, links, and other crazy stuff!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">What is this droid for?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sp-S6 (Sp) will be part of the DroidsContest. We aim to use him to raise awareness about our cause and other disabilities by taking him on protests, making videos about him, and more. He will be kept in the AoD HQ, and will be open to members of the public to try him out.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">What are we going to be making him out of?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Sp-D2 is (mostly) finished, we will just be adding some new parts, electronics, and furnishing him up. Of course, we will be adding a heap of new parts, but these will mostly be on the inside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the electronics, we will be using MarcDuino's (controlled by the iPod App R2-Touch), with a controller stuck onto him. The controller will be my iPod, and will be protected by a sliding panel (key-locked) and will also have a portable charger.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Who will be making him?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Myself, Ian Arbuckle, Liam Russell, &amp; Cameron are the main members of the DroidsContest. We will be having an update on the DroidsContest, with some new rules and loopholes for you guys to check out!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sp-D2 was built in Melbourne, so we are going to be needing to find a way to get him over here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My woodwork teacher will also be helping out at school.</p>
