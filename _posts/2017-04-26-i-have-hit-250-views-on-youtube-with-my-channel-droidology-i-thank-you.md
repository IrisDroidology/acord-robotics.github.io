<strong>YOUTUBE SPECIAL - 250 VIEWS!</strong>

According to YT, I currently have 252 views on my channel, thanks to you guys. My most popular videos are, of course, the Sp-D2 trailer and one of my more recent videos, Liam's Tips for Round 5 2017 AFL (120 &amp; 54 views respectively).

I am starting to make YT videos more often, and I will be posting the links to them on my profile, on Twitter, Facebook (I am trying to make a new FB page), Tumblr &amp; Patreon. I am also going to make a page on this website (<a class="wpforo-auto-embeded-link" href="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/youtube-vids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://allianceofdroids.org.au/youtube-vids/</a> that will have the videos embedded.

I hope you guys are happy for me and I will keep making videos on the channel.

<strong>Here is what will be on the channel:</strong>

GAMING: Xbox, PC, Mobile Devices

SCIENCE: Experiments, tutorials

AOD STUFF: Interviews, debriefs/briefings, etc.

AFL: Liam's preview (Essendon FC games), Liam's review
