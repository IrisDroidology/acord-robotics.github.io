<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier;">NEW THEME</span></h1>
<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">As you will know if you have been on this website before, we have just gone through some MASSIVE changes. We used to use a theme called Boss, which was made especially for our members, but we have now changed to the theme Divi, which you may have seen being advertised on YouTube.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">We changed the theme for a couple of reasons, the main one being we wanted a change and our old theme was a bit too complicated for some people. We are proud of both themes, but we definitely prefer this one.</span>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier;">THE APP</span></h1>
<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">The app that we are coding with scratch has not had much more work done on it lately, but the good news is that we have a TON of ideas for saving progress and whatnot. If you check out myÂ <a href="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/portfolio/" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>Â there are links to my scratch app and also the news on it.</span>
