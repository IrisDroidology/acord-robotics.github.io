<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, we are drawing ever closer to our 1st Anniversary, and we are getting closer to finalizing the details. Remember that you will be able to find all the information about this conference in this category. It now seems that it will be unlikely to be able to hire Hoyts Cinema, not just because of the price but because of our size. It would be a waste of money to spend so much on such a small group. I have been doing a bit of research, and have just sent off an email to <a href="http://joondalupresort.com.au/meetings-events/business-conference-meetings/?gclid=COmC3_ysoM8CFQubvQodk4sJ7w" target="_blank">Joondalup Resorts</a>, which hopefully will get answered soon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The conference will have a section for all our departments to speak about their members and experiences, and also sections for contests, milestones. The event is being hosted by the DroidsCouncil and being payed for by the D.C.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can come to the conference if you are a member, and there is no compulsory fee. But some of the members are willing to donate a small fee to our cause. We will hold a poll for what operation it will go to.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stay tuned!</p>
