<p style="text-align: justify;">I have been noticing that there are a lot of problems with the current theme for our blog, especially with the member pages. I have been trying to find some different themes, or maybe make my own theme, but for now I have not found anything.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our official forums provider is now wpForo, a plugin that allows us to have forums. They are still a work in progress, but you guys will be able to use them, no problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am also attempting to find a way to give members the chance to have a personal blog, that only their friends can read.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyone who knows a good theme should contact me, and if you are able to help create a new theme it would also be great. Thanks everyone!</p>
