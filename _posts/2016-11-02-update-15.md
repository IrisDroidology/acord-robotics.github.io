<h1 style="text-align: center;">...Today...</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello everyone, I am back today with another post on Sp~S6. Today is the 15th update and I am going to be talking about some other components that will be used in our companion droids, including Sp~S6.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I hope you enjoy this post, and please comment down below on what you think I should add to our droids.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Figures</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I love figures of droids, and I think maybe we should add some figures to our droids, and also make scale figures of our own droids. One of the figures series I was thinking of adding was the Disney Build-A-Droid (BAD). I was going to let you guys choose what droids we should add, and then I will add them to the body of our droids, like the badges on Sp-D2.Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The important thing to remember is this: one droid will be added for every accomplishment we complete - for example an R2-D2 for every droid we complete. We will do a poll on which droids we should add and what they should represent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The FaceBook group Astromech Alliance is free to join and has lots of ideas and images of figures.Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1287" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bad_poster2012_1490-738x1024.jpg" alt="bad_poster2012_1490" width="625" height="867" /></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Skins</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I am a big activist for gay and disabled rights. While these days disabled people are not able to be sacked because of their disability, you aren't saved from the awful bullying and abuse that goes on outside the work force. I know that this won't solve anything, but to show my support I want to add a component called SKINS to our droids.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">These skins will be either flags or cloaks, and will have logos, slogans or just colors that represent specific things - like a rainbow for Gay Pride, for example.Â </span></p>
