<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yesterday I met Professor Jane Burns from the University of Sydney. It was a great experience and I know I got a lot out of it. In this post I will talk about who she is, what will be happening and where it will go. A big thanks to Professor Burns for taking time out of her schedule to meet me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I had enquired about meeting her in September. She had planned to come to my home city, to do some talks. She was enthusiastic about meeting me, and was incredibly interested in what I had to say. We talked about stuff to do with disabilities, and also about the Alliance of Droids. Today she is doing a talk, including stuff about the Alliance of Droids. I am so happy that she wants to talk about the Alliance of Droids to people, because it shows that people are taking it - us - seriously.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">WhatÂ <em>could</em>Â come out of it?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Since Professor Burns is doing a talk, including information about the AoD, we may have an opportunity to work with a few people. We can also do other stuff, not just a robot, but other things that can help people with disabilities.Â </span></p>
