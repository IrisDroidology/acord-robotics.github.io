<p> ACoRCD Robotics is collaborating with 
numerous companies and organisations to create software with high-level 
machine learning capabilities. Here’s how we’re doing it!</p>

<ul><li>The purpose of machine learning is to teach computers how to learn from data to make decisions, or predictions</li><li>True machine learning occurs when the computer learns to identify patterns without being programmed to</li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Machine learning is often referred to/labelled as many other things:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Data Science</li><li>Big Data</li><li>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</li><li>Computation Statistics</li><li>Data Mining</li><li>Predictive Analysis</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However,
 while machine learning does overlap with these fields, it is one tool 
for data science. It is also one use of infrastructure that can handle 
big data</p>

<p>Your
 email provider (i.e. gmail) automatically places “dodgy” emails in your
 spam folder (however, this is not always perfect. Machine learning is 
designed to learn as you use the software, so the more messages you send
 to/remove from the spam folder, the better it will (theoretically) be)</p>

<p>Marketing
 &amp; advertising companies use behavior and demographic indicators to 
segment/separate their customers into targeted groups. This allows them 
to market different offers/products to different people. Because some 
people may like iPads and some may prefer Sony tablets, it is cheaper to
 determine who likes who and create smaller advertising campaigns for 
each group, rather than creating multiple campaigns for everyone.</p>

 computer and camera that are part of a self-driving car interact with
