<p style="text-align: justify;">The gaming department is going to be doing a variety of things for the gaming community, and I wanted to outline them here. You can become a member of the gaming department easily, either by signing up or contacting us. While there are a lot of obligations, the good part is that they are mostly fun and you can do them quickly, mostly there is no deadline to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Gaming Department is currently lead by one of my friends, Ducky, who has been a member since the start of 2016 and knows a lot about gaming. I have planned to give him a walk-through of what the department leaders have to do when I see him next at school.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Gaming Department primarily wants our readers and others to be able to game in a safe environment, make their own games and have fun gaming. Since so many people game these days we want a department for gaming.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We want to record our own game-play videos as well, and we do public requests of different games, although (not because I am a wimp, but because I don't see the point in it) some of us (me included) refuse to play games like C.O.D. &amp; B.O. 2. But you guys can still request us to record different games!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, we want to educate people aboutÂ <em>howÂ </em>to game. If you are in a well-off family that can afford to do this; you should get a gaming chair and if you want to record videos get a quality microphone. It is also important to pick the right computer for the games, and please use Steam for most games. In Steam you have achievements, badges, and more, which can be customized with your gaming details, profile and prestige. Steam has thousands of games and does regular sales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those who want to record videos on an xBox or a PlayStation, I don't know the best way to do this. I am pretty sure you need to pay for an external device.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Continue looking forward to this gaming series!</p>
