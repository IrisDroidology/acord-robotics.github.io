<h1 style="text-align: center;">New!</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, the CD Files are a new thing. We are going to be going over all our ideas for our companion droids in this series, and you will be able to find our ideas easily. Not only that, but you too can give us ideas for our robots!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Our ideas will include our parts lists, our functions list, and a small blog with cool information about some new technology.</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Our First Parts</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As most of you will know by now, on the 6th of November I worked with the members of the WA R2-D2 Builders Club, notably Andrew Campbell &amp; Grant. We made our very first part, the lower uprights. I want to talk about what they are for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have 8 of the lowest uprights, made out of styrene - basically imagine polystyrene but without the air in it. The basic purpose of them is to arrange them in a circle and then put a styrene base over it. We repeat this a few times, until we have the body about up to my shoulders/torso. The skin that we get will basically be the covering - this means that we won't see the actual styrene, but the styrene is there to support and make the frame.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I don't know when the next event is, but you will be able to check out when it is by going to these sites:</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Droid Design - Color</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For my droid, I have been deciding to go with the R3-S6 theme, from Star Wars The Clone Wars. But I also want to add a bit more style to him, so I may add some steampunk elements, like a trumpet. I will use some gold, silver, lots of black, and a bit of white.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">The Future &amp; Beginning of the CD's</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">Now, the droid I am building is going to be our prototype. The first CD's will be apps, with recordings and simulations of our droid prototype. But we will eventually have real robots in homes, but we need to have our first prototype as well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">We will have a function on both the app, and eventually the robot, that can play simple games, like Chess, or a game that stimulates the disabled kid's mind. We may also be able to make more complex games as well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">We will also have a simple diary, used for recording feelings and events, and a music/podcast player, and a guide for when you're feeling upset.</span></p>
