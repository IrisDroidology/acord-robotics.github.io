<h2 style="text-align: center;">Reply from Blue Frog Robots!</h2>
<div>Dear Liam,</div>
<div></div>
<div>First of all apologize us if we have missed to answer your previous email.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Thank you for your message and description of your activities within Alliance of Droids.</div>
<div>Although we understand that you‚Äôre willing to create companion robots for people with ASD, we would like to understand better what you are expecting from a company like Blue Frog.</div>
<div>
<div>What we can share with you from our side is that we have already tested BUDDY in several autism institutes to develop a special BUDDY package dedicated to children with special needs.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">We are looking for instance to develop apps that will help children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or other special needs for them to learn to communicate, interact with others, and be more autonomous.¬†</span></div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">For instance, a first app that we are looking at will help to understand the concept of time through a calendar and tasks feature. With this app, BUDDY will:</span></div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">1. Remind children and prepare a time schedule</span></div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">2. Provide assistance to perform the steps required to complete a task</span></div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">3. Display the passing of time though visual timers</span></div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">4. Motivate and congratulate once done through fun animations</span></div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">¬†</span></div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">Here is one example of how children with ASD might work with BUDDY:¬†¬†</span></div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">BUDDY says, ‚ÄúIt is time to go eat, you have to wash your hands now.‚Äù He then displays a video on his face showing how to wash hands step-by-step, with timers and a funny animation.¬†</span></div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">Once the task is completed, BUDDY dances and congratulates the child. Plans, video, timers and pictures are completely customizable ‚Äì for instance they can use photos of a comfortable environment (home, school, etc.).</span></div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">¬†</span></div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">We have preliminary tested BUDDY with an Institute for Children with Autism</span><span lang="EN-US">¬†with some games applications that we have developed internally and the results have been amazing. As shown in this¬†</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&amp;v=3P2Rj90zVyE" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue%3D5%26v%3D3P2Rj90zVyE&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1477477190995000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGyGvykIECNr3nTgH19KecG_CDqDQ"><span lang="EN-US">video</span></a><span lang="EN-US">, when the children meet BUDDY for the first time, BUDDY arouses their curiosity and they immediately gather around him to join the activities offered by BUDDY.</span></div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">We strongly believe that BUDDY could help autistic children with their learning and communication skills.¬†</span></div>
<div>BUDDY can provoke interactions and stimulate the child with a reassuring neutral attitude. One of the best things about BUDDY; he has infinite patience, and will do things over and over, never getting upset or tired.</div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">And most importantly, due to its friendly appearance the robot is a great companion for kids with special needs. We've designed BUDDY for people to adopt a new member in family. So, BUDDY generates empathy and an emotional connection almost instantaneously. There is something about him that makes children feel affection for him. We invested significant resources to ensure that our companion robot would be seen as friendly and non-intimidating which is a major point for a robot that‚Äôs meant to interact with children with ASD.</span></div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">Last but not least, BUDDY, equipped with microphones, cameras and sensors enable voice, touch and face recognition, all designed to make him as interactive as possible. BUDDY is therefore in combination with third party apps the perfect tool: intuitive, help focus, playful, fun and mobile.</span></div>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">¬†</span></div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">Best regards</span></div>
