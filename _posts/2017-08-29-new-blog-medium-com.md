<h2>What is Medium.com?</h2>
Hi everyone. Welcome back to another post on our blog in the blog changes category. In this post I will be bringing you all the info about our blog on medium.com.

Medium.com is a free-to-use blogging platform that we will be using to share some PUBLIC news about the AoD.

My public profile is http://medium.com/@Droidologuy and our publication (AoD) is http://medium.com/alliance-of-droids/, with hopes to change it to a domain like blog.allianceofdroids.org.au or something like that.

Remember, we are only posting PUBLIC AoD news on medium.com, not private news, which will only be available on the portal.

Limo, out.
