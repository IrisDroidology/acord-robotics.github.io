It has been announced that Donald J. Trump is using his initials to gain fame in the music industry!

Donald Trump, the current (crappy) president of the United States,Â has gained international fame by publishing his (crappy) videos of being a DJ online on his new YouTube channel, DJTrump.

"I've always wanted to be a musician because of my name, and I think that being a DJ is pretty special!" said Donald. "I know everyone loves me and wants to be like me, so I am helping kids reach their dreams and potential."

I interviewed hundreds of kids across America, and they all said the same thing: "DJ Trump...more like DJ Dump."

Donald also announced that he received his DJ equipment from the local dump.
