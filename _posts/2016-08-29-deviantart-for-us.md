I am extremely excited that I now have my very own Deviant Art page for the Alliance of Droids, located @ <a href="http://alliance-of-droids.deviantart.com">alliance-of-droids.deviantart.com</a>. I also have my personal Deviant Art Page (<a href="http://lieutenantliam.deviantart.com">http://lieutenantliam.deviantart.com</a>).

We are going to be posting our artwork, our droids and more. In my personal page I will be posting my photography artwork and more personal stuff. You guys will also be able to buy the artwork from this shop if you would like to!

Thanks everyone!

Note: If any member has any artwork they want to post, or their droid or something, send the photos to me and I can post it on our portfolio Deviant Art page!
