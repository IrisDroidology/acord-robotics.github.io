Well, I want to explain something very important today. When I first formed the Alliance of Droids, it was originally going to be kept secret. But then I decided to make it public, so more people could see my work, and the work of the Alliance itself.

But, I think that i want to honor that idea now, by making a set of pages JUST for the most senior members. Currently (5/12/2016), the members included in this set are:
<ul>
 	<li>Liam Arbuckle // @liamaod // @LieutenantDroid</li>
 	<li>Nicholas Antipas// @Nichoyoshi</li>
 	<li>Ian Arbuckle</li>
 	<li>Kiran Reeves // @kiranthereeeveeeezÂ Kirania</li>
 	<li>Sean Firth</li>
 	<li>Amulya</li>
 	<li>Aria</li>
</ul>
This is the current list, and expect a post on how to be added to this list to come soon, maybe today!

Regards, Liam
