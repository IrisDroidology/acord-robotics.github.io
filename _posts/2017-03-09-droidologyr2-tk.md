<p style="text-align: justify;">Droidologyr2.tk is my droidfolio website that can also be seen here: http://droidology.000webhostapp.com. It is a sort of website for personal use, as well as the R2-D2 Builders Club posts and more. I hopefully can change it to something like droidology.allianceofdroids.org.au, or maybe droidology.space. With the hostgator plan that Sean is going to buy for us, we can hopefully change the .com Godaddy domain to droidology.space/.me/.com/.net.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And if the worst comes to the worst, we can just leak all my posts here.</p>
