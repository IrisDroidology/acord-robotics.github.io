<p style="text-align: justify;">Unless you know nothing about Star Wars, you would know that the Alliance is named after Star Wars (specifiically, the droids).Â But I want to use this post to talk about the influence Star Wars has had on the Alliance of Droids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Star Wars is a multi-billion dollar franchise and one of the most well-known movie franchises of all time. First seen by the public in 1977, it has become a much-loved story for fans worldwide.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Alliance of Droids, formed in 2015, has taken a lot of ideas from Star Wars. Firstly, we have droids, helpers, and Jedi-like characters, but above all we have a sense of belief in ourselves to make the world and the galaxy a better place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is what the Alliance of Droids and Star Wars have in common.</p>
