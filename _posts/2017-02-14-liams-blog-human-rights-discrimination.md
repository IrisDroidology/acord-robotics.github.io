<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to the last post in the Human Rights mini-series of my blog. In this post I will be looking at discrimination, which, according to Google, is</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people, especially on the grounds of race, age, or sex.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Google Search, 2017</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a variety of human rights to do with discrimination in my country, and there are others in countries like America, Britain, &amp; so on. Discrimination is something that I detest and that should not happen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let's take a closer look:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Those that discriminate are scared of who THEY really are</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Discrimination 101</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building on the Google Search definition, discrimination is a totally not-called for way of describing - bullying - someone who is different. Racism is a form of discrimination. You may have seen in the media information about racism, which has been quite frequent in the news recently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People who are different have always been discriminated against. Even going to war can be a form of discrimination. When the crusades (European Countries Vs. "Holy" Countries such as Israel) were going on, the attackers (the Europeans) were raiding towns because of TWO reasons -</p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">They didn't like the culture and the way they were "ruining the 'holy' land that God made for us, and only us."</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">It was also a sense of adventure, a way to avoid prosecution and get paid well for it</li>
</ul>
Is killing and murdering an adventure? Certainly, for murderers and thieves, it could well be. This is one of the most famous examples of racism, although no-one actually seems to accept it as racism rather than a "Victory for God's 'Holy' men."
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another form of discrimination is the so-called age discrimination. For example, in Australia the youngest you can be (when you work at a cafe, shop, restraunt, etc.) is 14 years and 9 months, although there are quite a lot of employers that ignore the younger workers. This is age discrimination.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gender/sex discrimination is STILL going on and has been going on for CENTURIES. Even today, women get paid MUCH, MUCH less than the average man in THE SAME JOB. In 2015, women earned only 80 cents for every dollar a man earnt IN THE SAME JOB.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Discrimination against gay/homosexuals is also a big one that has recently been in the news a lot. People argue that because marriage is between a MAN AND A WOMAN, gay marriage is not legitimate. But that is like calling me a bastard child (none of my parents are married).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These "laws" were created by the Catholic Church, and it even says in the Bible that gay people should receive the DEATH penalty. Seriously. The Church still holds power over many of us. Religion should not get in the way of science, politics or the like (look at Galileo). Personally I have nothing against Christian PEOPLE but I have everything against the RELIGION itself (cough cough Cardinal George Pell).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks for reading</p>
