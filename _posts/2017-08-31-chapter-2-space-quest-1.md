Our young man that we met in the previous chapter, Limo Jack, had been 23 when the Earth had become uninhabitable and had been on the ISS when the ships were flying up.

Jack had been a young science blogger when he was on Earth, and had somehow found his way onto the International Space Station when he was just 21, with just a minimal amount of sweet-talking.

Jack's role on the ISS was originally supposed to be an agricultural scientist with a degree in biochemistry, however when he turned 23 he became the head of the biological experiments in the Australian wing.

Jack had done poor/okay? in school tests until he was 15, when he suddenly burst onto the scene as one of the best students in the school. He was in a selective school and had been since he was 12, however he struggled due to bullying and distractions in class.

Jack now had a new role: find a way to duplicate the food that the robots had grown in the past 200 years easily, safely and cheaply so that they could last until the wormhole was ready to be used.

As already mentioned, the robots had grown 20 months of food, however due to the late awakening of the humans almost all (about 14 months) of the food had to be used almost immediately to get them back to full strength. Jack calculated that they could create the 2 months of food needed (it would take another 8 months to get the wormhole ready and there was only 6 months of food left) in less than a week with exactly 8 matter duplicators.

After this stunning revelation, he went down into his office to e-mail the techies and say:

"I have calculated that we need another 7 matter duplicators. Please reply. Limo"

After sending this email, he slouched to the cafe outside his office and poured himself another glass of water.
