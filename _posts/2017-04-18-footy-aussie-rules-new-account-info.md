Hey again everyone! My name is Limo (you can call me Liam), and I am the CEO &amp; Co-Founder of the Alliance of Droids.
<p style="text-align: justify;">Is this sounding a bit weird to you? Yes, I am using another account. My Droid Builder account (http://allianceofdroids.org.au/members/Droidology) is available to DB's only, but the account I am using (currently http://allianceofdroids.org.au/members/droidologyiris/) is available to everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am going to be doing another post on some proposed features for the website, but for now, please sit back and relax and enjoy the post!</p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a big fan of Australian Football (known as Aussie Rules/AFL - Australian Football League), and I support the Essendon Bombers in the AFL. I have just started playing for a disabled community group called the Willeton Football Club, and I will post pictures of the training singlet in both my profiles as well as on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and more.</p>
