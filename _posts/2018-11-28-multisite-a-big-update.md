<h1 style="text-align: center;">What is multisite?</h1>
WordPress multisite is a way that different sites can be connected - i.e. using the same install. This means that you could have a company home page and a blog. They would both be connected (they have the same users, plugins, etc.) however they can have different themes and could even have different plugins active at different times. You could have woocommerce (an e-commerce plugin) active on the shop page but not on the blog website as it may affect the loading time. You could also have a site that can be viewed on mobile devices to present a different theme to that demographic.

Multisite will be especially useful for us because of our insane loading times. We have so many plugins that ARE needed, but it would be great if different parts of the network weren't using every plugin. For example, jetpack is really useful for our blogging, but it doesn't make much sense on the shop, and it is one of the reasons why our loading times are so high.
<h1 style="text-align: center;">How it would work</h1>
Every page on this site would be counted as one site - the master site. Every plugin would be active.

However, I could create another site on this network called BLOG. The button on the top menu would link there, but it would be (technically) a different site. The cool thing is that all users are synced across, so if you register on this site you don't have to re-register for 40 different sites.

Another thing that would be even better with multisite is our membership system - buddypress, ultimate member, and peepso. All of these are great, but different groups need them. The other thing is that we use the YOUZER plugin to "skin" <a href="http://buddypress.org">Buddypress</a>. Sometimes we want the default buddypress look (it is customized per theme) and sometimes we want <a href="http://youzer.kainelabs.com">Youzer</a>. We may also want to have different header layouts for each site.

Each department would have a site, and all the data would be linked into the main site (this one). All of them will be members-only.

The other thing that would be useful is the ability to use different themes. Currently, the themes we hope to use include:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://elegantthemes.com">Divi</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://dunhakdis.com">Thrive</a> (our current one)</li>
 	<li><a href="http://seventhqueen.com">Kleo</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://seventhqueen.com">Buddyapp</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">The problem</h1>
Back in 2016, when we temporarily used the domain allianceofdroids.com, we tried to set up multisite. Unfortunately, it mostly worked, but then we moved back to allianceofdroids.org.au. Because of this domain change, the multisite was a bit stuffed up. We're planning to hire a developer to fix that problem.
