Another month gone, another month started. We're now a third of the way through April, however I haven't uploaded any videos since late last month. The usual reasons apply here.

However, Mesaville is coming back to YouTube, and it will be better than ever. Let's see what we are going to do in the next few episodes (hopefully these will all be uploaded to YouTube by the end of April).

<strong>Episode 4 (Season 2)</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Start work on the farm (i.e. expanding it to allow it to be large but also underground</li>
	<li>Harvesting crops</li>
	<li>Setting up a base (chicken coop, farm) in the village in the plains biome</li>
	<li>Harvest wood</li>
</ul>
<strong>Episode 5 (Season 2)</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Add more animals to the farm</li>
	<li>Start a mine</li>
</ul>
<strong>Episode 5 (Season 2)</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Continue mining from last episode</li>
	<li>Food harvesting</li>
</ul>
<strong>Episode 6 (Season 2)</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Random (To be decided)</li>
</ul>
