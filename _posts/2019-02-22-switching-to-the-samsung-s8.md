<h1 style="text-align: center;">I'll admit it, I'm an Android fanboy</h1>
But it wasn't always this way. When I turned 10, I was given a red iPod touch 5 for my birthday and I fell in love with it.

<p style="text-align: left;">Late 2014, I was given a cheap samsung phone for school. I hated it, especially since I'd been a happy iOS user for 2 years. I eventually upgraded to a samsung core prime in 2016, and as soon as I discovered the customizability (especially the launchers) of Android, I said to my parents: "This is what I've been wanting!"</p>

That year, I was given a Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 for my 14th birthday, and I have plans to upgrade it to the Tab S4 or the S5e next year. Currently I'm on an iPhone 5s, which is a big step backwards from my Oppo A57, especially in regards to the camera.

But in December last year, I received word from a friend of my dad's that my torture would be over! I'd be getting a Pixel 2...and then I wasn't. Luckily, this friend of my dad's was so nice that he said that he'd buy a brand new phone, whatever I wanted. And I picked an Android - the Samsung S8.

I could've gone for the Pixel 1, but the battery was sketchy (my dad owns one) and it's quite old. The Pixel 2 had a crappy design (which is important to me), and like on the Pixel 1 the navigation bar would never go away. I didn't want to ask for a Pixel 3 or the S9, because although these problems were mostly fixed in this models I didn't want to ask for a really expensive phone.

So the S8 was a good bet. Although it's 2 years old (and will hopefully be 4 when I next upgrade), it had good battery life, especially if it was purchased from a store rather than second-hand. It had all 3 biometrics, Samsung's One UI, Android Oreo (please, please let it get Android Pie), and Samsung Knox. The fingerprint sensor was in an awkward position, but it didn't matter.

On the 29th of March, I'm getting an S8. Here's what I'm going to do with it
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Launcher</h1>

What is an Android launcher?
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="ILfuVd"><b>Launcher</b> is the name given to the part of the <b>Android</b> user interface that lets users customize the home screen (e.g. the phone's desktop), launch mobile apps, make phone calls, and perform other tasks on <b>Android</b> devices (devices that use the <b>Android</b> mobile operating system).</span> - Webopedia</p>

That's quite a mouthful. Let's break it down.

If you have a smartphone, from the start you'll see a home screen with a bunch of icons. On an iPhone they'll be arranged from the top left downwards, on android you can place them anywhere. This part of the screen is the desktop, like on your computer. These icons launch applications and sit on top of a wallpaper.

With Android, users can customize the behaviour of their phone by installing a launcher. Nova Launcher is one of the most popular. I'm thinking of going with either Nova or Microsoft. Here's the reasoning.

<strong>Microsoft Launcher</strong>

Pros
<ul>
 	<li>Integrates well with Microsoft (displays Microsoft documents + calendar + to-do list on home screen)</li>
 	<li>Brilliantly designed widget section to the left (like the spotlight on iOS)</li>
 	<li>Modern feel (finally added the swipe to open app drawer feature from Android Nougat)</li>
 	<li>Supports icon packs</li>
 	<li>Bing wallpaper of the day - personally not for me but good for people who like good quality photos</li>
 	<li>Good - but not great - customizability</li>
 	<li>Ability to hide apps</li>
 	<li>Dark mode</li>
 	<li>Notifications</li>
 	<li>Home screens: widgets, icons, frequently used apps, documents, notes, calendar (you can choose from these)</li>
</ul>
Cons
<ul>
 	<li>Good - but not great - customizability</li>
 	<li>Can feel clunky</li>
 	<li>If you like having your calendar or your documents on your home screen (swipe to the right to see that screen), it's awkward to have more than one page for your icons</li>
 	<li>If you do, you have to swipe up to view your second page of icons, which removes the app drawer swipe feature</li>
</ul>
<strong>Nova Launcher</strong>

Pros
<ul>
 	<li>Unparalleled customizability</li>
 	<li>Unique per-appÂ  notification icons</li>
 	<li>Ability to hide apps</li>
 	<li>Frequent updates</li>
 	<li>Modern feel</li>
 	<li>Supports icon packs</li>
 	<li>Sesame shortbreads</li>
</ul>
Cons
<ul>
 	<li>Most features require premium membership</li>
 	<li>No spotlight section</li>
</ul>
Of course, I may just stick with Samsung's One UI for now...
