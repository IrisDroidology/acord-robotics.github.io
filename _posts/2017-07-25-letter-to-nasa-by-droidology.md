<div>Hi there</div>
<div>I am Liam Arbuckle and I emailed you a few years ago asking about a job (I was about 11 at the time).</div>
<div>I am 14 now and I want you to know how much science and NASA has meant to me over the past 14 years of my life. I just want you to know this because I have an idea, a partnership, between me and you.</div>
<div>I was 4 years old when I read my first book on space, called planets (2006, Seymour Simon?), and I was hooked instantly. I am autistic and also suffer from depression. The book was probably the thing that made me be who I am, and it has made me be so interested in working with you.</div>
<div>I get bullied a lot and this has made me form an organisation with my cousin, Nick. This has enabled me to do something I am proud of.</div>
<div>I made a vow, when I was 4, that I would do something to do with science in my life. I want to go to university, get a job and finally be a scientist.</div>
<div>I go to a selective school, where you had to sit an academic exam to get in. This has been a huge challenge - I was top of the class in primary school, but I am somewhere around the middle in high school. Our courses are based on the Australian standard for the year above us, and this means that my scores may seem low but they are for the above year.</div>
<div>My organization, the Alliance of Droids, is a charity dedicated to making the world a better place for me as well as people with disabilities. We do this by making things known as "Companion Droids." I am applying for a grant to fund these and hope that they will reduce suicide risks in teens.</div>
<div>I am sorry if this seems like I am rambling but I need you to know everything about me.</div>
<div>I have attempted to commit suicide a number of times. I am COMPLETELY fine at the moment, I am serious. But these attempts have always been because I am scared of breaking my vow that I mentioned above ^.</div>
<div>I want to work with NASA, Mars-One, the ESA &amp; CSIRO (at least one) to make my dream a reality.</div>
<div>I want to help with robotics ideas for your missions. I was reading THE SEARCH FOR EARTH'S TWIN, and I know about how you select your missions. I want to be able to help with some ideas because while I don't even have a degree I think that I can think of some ideas that you could use.</div>
<div>I completed the Coursera Astrobiology course (<a href="http://coursera.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=http://coursera.org&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1501032409777000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcbIx7fH8AJK4ejJCvpqKE4YDICQ">http://coursera.org</a>) when I was 12 with an average of 83%, and I think that I have a lot to give to you and science.</div>
<div>I want you to be proud of me and to be remembered as someone that helped you. I want to be proud of my accomplishments and I want to have completed the vow (again, I mentioned it above ^).</div>
<div>I can code, learn quickly and so much more.</div>
<div>I am not asking for money, I just want to fulfill my dreams.</div>
<div>I understand that it is easier if I am an adult, but I am just scared for a lot of reasons (for example, since I want to take the AoD further, I may not be working at Ames or JPL, and because I MAY die soon), and I want to help YOU.</div>
<div>I am not some mentally deranged kid that is bugging you, and I mean everything I say.</div>
<div>I want to help you.</div>
<div>My website is available here:Â <a href="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=http://allianceofdroids.org.au&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1501032409777000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEtC-RDtHkLJS1sQ3Vonvl6FedVOQ">http://allianceofdroids.org.au</a></div>
<div>Everything I say came from the heart, and please help me. I will repay you. I promise.</div>
<div>Limo</div>
