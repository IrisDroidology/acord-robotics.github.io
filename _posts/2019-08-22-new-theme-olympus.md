<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was looking around for some good buddypress themes just out of interest on Wednesday or Thursday, and I came across a theme called ‚ÄúOlympus‚Äù. Now, I had no real intentions of changing the theme of the ACORD website from Aardvark - it had, after all, served me pretty well. The only real problem I had with Aardvark was the header menu, but that could easily be fixed, and the other members of ACORD had no problem with it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that all changed when I came across the Olympus theme.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59507" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/01_mainpreview.__large_preview.jpg" alt="01_mainpreview.__large_preview" width="590" height="300" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This theme uses a plugin called </span><a href="http://youzer.kainelabs.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youzer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The cool thing about this plugin is that it gives a complete overhaul of the traditional buddypress structure and layout, and adds a number of really awesome things as well:</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New buddypress tab - overview. This is where users can set widgets for their profile, for example portfolio or about me</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">14 different header styles</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Completely customizable navigation</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much more - check out </span><a href="http://youzer.kainelabs.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see more</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôd tangled with Youzer in the past when I was using the Thrive theme by Dunhakdis, however it had become a bit of an eyesore with Thrive contrasting strongly with it. I contemplated going back to it with Aardvark, however the Aardvark theme was fine without it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But a theme built </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youzer? That was something that I‚Äôd never seen before, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">definitely</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> something worth looking into.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The theme doesn‚Äôt have many customization options available via the wordpress customizer, however there isn‚Äôt really much need for the level of customization seen in the other themes I‚Äôve used. The site looks perfect and definitely has a much more minimal look than the previous theme.</span>
