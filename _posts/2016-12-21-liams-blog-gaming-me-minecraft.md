Minecraft is one of my favorite games in the whole entire universe. I have played it on:
<ul>
 	<li>iPod 5G (Lite/Free Version since 2012) (Full Version since 2013)</li>
 	<li>PC (Since 2014)</li>
 	<li>XboxÂ One (Since 2015)</li>
</ul>
Basically, Minecraft is a game that involves surviving against monsters and building houses and cool contraptions. Minecraft was released to the public in 2009 and was officially released (went out of beta) in 2011. It is the 3rd most popular video game of all time, with over 20 million PC downloads and 70 million purchases across PC, Mac, iOS, Android, Xbox &amp; PlayStation, PS Vita, and other consoles.

It is a non-violent game, with the default game having no blood, but of course, you can install "mods" or modifications that can change the game - there are thousands of mods for different versions. This means you can customize the game to be how YOU want it to be.

Here are some great mods:
<ul>
 	<li>Galacticraft (Fly to the moon &amp; Mars, fight monsters, etc.) - Versions 1.7.10</li>
 	<li>Maggi's Star Wars Mod - Version 1.7.10</li>
 	<li>Paxxi's Star Wars Mod - Versions 1.7.10, 1.9, 1.10.2</li>
 	<li>Pixelmon (Pokemon) - Versions 1.6 &amp; Higher</li>
 	<li>Telepads (Set up bases that you can easily teleport to) - 1.7.10, 1.10.2?</li>
</ul>
There are also a great range of texture packs, now called resource packs. These change what Minecraft looks like for you, and you can even make your own. Some good ones include:
<ul>
 	<li>Invictus - Version 1.7.10 (and possibly others - help me out here!)</li>
 	<li>Faithful - Versions 1.8, 1.8.8, 1.9, 1.9.4, 1.10, 1.10.2, 1.11</li>
</ul>
Remember to check what versions your texture packs/mods require before updating Minecraft because this can cause the mods to become incompatible. The current version is 1.11.

There are also a large amount of servers. Servers are community-run worlds that can be just survival or full of minigames, PvP (Player vs. Player), teams, Creative, Survival, and more. Here are a few of my favorites:
<ul>
 	<li>Mineplex (Minigames, Ultra Hardcore, Rewards, etc.) - eu.mineplex.com OR us.mineplex.com</li>
 	<li>Tiki-Craft (Survival) - tiki-craft.net</li>
 	<li>Royal Legacy Network - RLN (Survival, Prison, Factions) - royallegacy.us</li>
 	<li>And of course, check out more servers at www.minecraftservers.org</li>
