The Alliance of Droids will become the Corporation of Robots. After trying (unsuccessfully) to get permission to trademark the AoD, we (the AoD External Board) have changed our name and will be trademarking COR.

&nbsp;
<h1>What does this mean?</h1>
<ul>
 	<li>We will still refer to us in the portal as the AoD, but also the COR</li>
 	<li>Our domain (web address) will change</li>
 	<li>Our logo will change</li>
</ul>
<h1>When will this change?</h1>
The domain will change within a year, depending on how long Sean (http://mindbuzz.com.au) has registered our current domain for.

The logo is ready (almost, the cover image is our final draft).
<h1>The Board Reshuffle</h1>
Nicholas has become Chief Operations Officer on the external board, while I (Limo Arbuckle) will be moving into the role of Chairman. Because of this, we will be needing a new CEO.

In terms of the Droids Council, Nick will be a Design Leader for Droids, while I will be staying on as Design Leader and Chairman.
