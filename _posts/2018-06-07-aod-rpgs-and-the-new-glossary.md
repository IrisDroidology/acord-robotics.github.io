<h1 style="text-align: center;">The AoD RPG</h1>
After playing a game called Star Wars Combine (http://swcombine.com) for a few weeks, I have been looking at getting a similar sort of game created for Alliance of Droids members, and eventually anyone will be able to play it. I am thinking of having levels of membership, so game players may be on the portal, however would only be able to view items related to the RPG. There will be more on this shortly.

The game will be set in the Space Quest Universe, with elements from Star Wars, Harry Potter, Doctor Who, and many more universes on request.
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Currency</h3>
On the portal, there has been a points system for a number of months now. Whenever you make a status update, add items to your droidfolio, and so on, you will be able to earn credits. There can be different credit types, so we plan on having another system that you can use in the role playing game. As you are able to buy items from the shop and from other droidlings already, it would be something we could use.

We plan for members to buy items, like ships or droids, in certain areas after completing certain tasks - see below
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Goals of the Game</h3>
There will be certain tasks that members have to complete, whether it be creating an alien species or flying a certain distance. These will give you points, as well as items that can only be earned by receiving those achievements. It is your choice what you do, you can create factions/alliances, rule the universe, etc. You can also turn PVP mode on or off so people can't attack you.
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Disclaimer</h3>
No non-members of the AoD will be able to view AoD blog posts or user profiles. However, eventually they will have access to the portal only for the game. They will have restrictions so they can only view certain things. For droid-related work, please use your BP profile (http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/droidlings/your-username/ - message @DroidologyIris for help with this.

Non-droidlings will view their faction, their credit balance, and their items, as well as other in-game statistics, but they will only see posts to do with the game.

Eventually, like in a few years, I plan to put money towards getting a larger server space, as well as having an off-line version of the portal and the game.

We will be coding the game in certain ways - the portal version as well as other easter eggs, like scratch-embedded game snippets.
<h1 style="text-align: center;">The glossary</h1>
The final part of this post is about the Glossary. The Glossary will be a page that will have all the terms used on the portal, split into sections - AoD work and the RPG. It will have the requirements for levels, department roles, etc. It is currently not being actively worked on but IT WILL HAPPEN.

Thanks for reading!
