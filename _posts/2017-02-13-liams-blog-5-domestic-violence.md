<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier;">LAST TIME...</span></h1>
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier;">Hey everyone, last time there was a slight problem with the post about bullying. The extra information that I posted is lost, but hopefully you will be able to see a special post with the exta info later this year.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier;">Last time we posted about bullying. Now we are talking about DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. Domestic violence, also known as domestic abuse, is an aggressive behavior in the house, typically involving the husband or spouse. A lot of the time it could be due to alcohol, drugs or stress, and some people are just the sort of people that do it and don't care. In this post we will talk about what it is and some helpful tips to do with domestic abuse.Â </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">Domestic Violence is dangerous in part because of the fact it can happen to ANYONE, to ANY family. It isn't just the alcohol adicts, the guys who shoot up on drugs, but sometimes it is just ordinary families. That is the thing to remember - it doesn't matter who you are, nor what religion/nationality you are. But some religions/cultures CAN influence (slightly - normally) domestic violence.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">There are many types of domestic violence, not just physical abuse. Both husband and wife can abuse each other socially, emotionally, and physically. Something else to keep in mind is that it doesn't just happen in the HOME, but the official definition is in the home. Basically it can happen anywhere, but DOMESTIC VIOLENCE happens between two people in a married relationship (note: not everyone who has kids and is in a relationship is married, I know, but I am currently refering to them as MARRIED people).</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif;">These are some examples of domestic violence:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>Kicking/Hitting/Smacking - NOT playfully</li>
 	<li>Threats or illegal persuasion</li>
 	<li>Name-calling (bastard child, for example, or f****** ****)</li>
 	<li>Using children (for personal gain)</li>
 	<li>Using male privledge</li>
 	<li>Economic abuse</li>
 	<li>Emotional abuse<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3175 size-full" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Domestic-Violence-examples.jpg" width="728" height="546" /></li>
 	<li>Isolation</li>
 	<li>Denying</li>
 	<li>Blaming in a hurtful way</li>
 	<li>Using intimidation</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">WAYS TO COMBAT IT</h2>
The main thing to remember with domestic violence is that if you don't tell anyone, you will keep on suffering. If you are afraid that the culprit will go to jail, remember that if they are doing this to you they are not worth living with anyway. If you are worried about your kids and what they will think, remember that no-one wants to have their parents - or especially not themselves - go through it. MAKE YOURSELF HEARD!

This is the most important step. Also, go to www.beyondblue.org.au OR lifeline.org.au to make yourself heard and find help.
