<p style="text-align: justify;">We are back with another series of My Life in Science (My Science Life - MSL). I am starting a new series because I want to change how I do it. I have renamed it to MSL because of the acronym - Mars Science Lab?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this series I will be talking about what I have done in science, including experiments and activities, and the inspiration I have found to give me this passion. I also will talk about some controversial figures and stories in my time that may be fixed by science.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Â THEÂ <em><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">ESSENDONÂ </span></em><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">SCANDAL</span></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, this may seem a bit off-topic, but I want to explain why I have chosen to talk about this. Like Making A Murderer (Steven Avery), chemistry &amp; body evidence (like DNA) may either free or capture both Steven &amp; Essendon. I am also a loyal supporter of the Essendon Bombers, and I have been for many years. Essendon are in the Australian Football League, basically Australian footy. I won't go into all the details about how to play AFL, but I will go into the science behind the scandal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2012, Essendon was involved in an alleged scandal - a team-based supplements program, involving the prohibited drug, Thymosin-Beta 4. I was unaware of this until the following year, as most of Australia was, because the Bombers were first revealed early in 2013. I stand by my belief that the Bombers, while they may have done things wrong, are innocent as they were not told about the drug TB4. As a result, Essendon has been through 3 years of hell, with the climax being last year and early 2016 when the World Anti-DopingÂ Agency found Essendon 'guilty' and banned 34 players (who were with the club at the time of the alleged scandal) from sporting activities for the 2016 season - which meant the 12 players still at Essendon were unable to play for the whole year, with the Bombers relying on a series of top-up players from other clubs, mainly young players, to fill the gap.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to take a moment to ackowledge that Essendon did wrong, but also to say that many other teams have been involved in TEAM-BASED drug scandals. Essendon had to be made an example of, which is fair. It shows the no-nonsense approach that WADA &amp; ASADA (Australian Sports Anti-Doping Agency) will go to in sport to the fans. But is it fair that the fans have been through 3 years of heartache?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to talk about the phycology of the scandal. Humans like to live in groups. We therefore 'go with the pack,' and since everyone on TV was talking about the Bombers (in Aussie Land anyway) Scandal, it appealed to many people. Not to mention that the media version was the only one known at the time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The media often stretches the truth to make their arguments or stories sell better. The media do often make up stuff, even on reliable news sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was no other group of people saying anything other than we were guilty and deserved punishment - except our fans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People, even people of great knowledge, often jump to conclusions, therefore saving time - or so people say. But there was a lot going on backstage, that not everyone knows about.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last year, just before the 2015 season started, Essendon were found not-guilty and were officially cleared, playing their first two matches with extreme passion, pushing Sydney to the brink (losing by 12 points after being up by a huge margin earlier), and beating Hawthorn by 2 points (after leading Hawthorn for most of the game, Essendon got the last 3 goals of the game to win, in the last 10 minutes). But then the axe fell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again, I won't go into this, but I want to say that there is a lot of evidence that not all the 34 players did wrong, and this may not seem like it has anything to do with science, but in my opinion it does. We are only looking at one side of the story and this is why wars happen, because humans are locked on opposing sides.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">MYÂ <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">AM<strong>BITIONS</strong></span></em></h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1565" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/space-facebook-cover-3.jpg" alt="space-facebook-cover-3" width="851" height="315" /></p>
My main dream is becoming a scientist and making a breakthrough discovery. But I have other dreams, like ridding the world of discrimination and world peace. While these may or may not be realistic goals, I still mention them because it shows who I am.

My first dream, becoming a scientist, means the world to me. I often say that my greatest fear is not becoming a scientist, which is completely true. I fell in love with science when I was 3 and have loved every second of it since.

There are many types of sciences, and my favorites are robotics, astronomy and chemistry. I look at people like Brian Cox &amp; Dr Karl for inspiration.

<span>I want to design a companion robot because I love Star Wars (R2-D2 included), and it is a type of science. That is probably my favorite goal.</span>

Being an astronaut was my dream from the first time I picked up the memorable book written by Seymour Simon in 2006,Â <em>Planets</em>. I often asked my dad if he had wanted to become an astronaut when he was my age and he had said yes. In his day, space exploration was only just proving successful, as he was born just after Yuri Gagarin left Earth. Like guys these days like cars and engines, back in his day everyone wanted to know if we could survive in space.

I always wanted to go to the Moon, and I often had dreams of commanding a space shuttle when I was only 5. I didnâ€™t know back then that space shuttles werenâ€™t used to go to the moon, but obviously I do now.

I dreamed of collecting moon rocks, finding signs of life on Mars and making new discoveries. I made rocket designs and played role playing games with dad. When I was 5, I did a presentation on the solar system, and I got an award for it. I was so proud of myself when my name was called out at the assembly. As it turns out, that was the first of many, many awards I would get at primary school, but we will go into that later.

My interest in becoming an astronaut waned when I entered the first grade, when it was taken over by the guitar and rock star ambitions. But it was always in the back of my mind, and it remains that way today.

In 2016, 9 years after I first read that book, I still want to be a scientist. The only reason I would go into space is to help grow a new colony on Mars, the Moon, Venus, or some other heavenly body. I want to make the world a better place.

This is important for the Alliance of Droids so that others can see the life autistic kids live and maybe learn more about themselves, which is what we aim to do.

<span>It all started with a book that I got for a birthday present (I think). Actually, a couple â€“ How to Catch a Star was one. The main one was Planets, by Seymour Simon, in 2006. It came with 3-D Glasses and I loved it from the beginning. It taught me a lot more than some other books have, even if they were for older kids.Â </span>

<span>I loved it because it explained science to me in a way I understood, even at that young age. I remember reading it with dad, and by the time I was four and a half, I could read it by myself with no help. I read it to my Year 1 class for Book Week.Â </span>

<span>I still treasure this book and it is still with me.</span>

<span>I also became more passionate about science due to the excellent schooling I have now. My passion has only ignited even more since coming to Perth Modern.Â </span>

<span>Science is special because there is never an end to what I can discover. I love astrobiology â€“ I love most sciences. It makes science fiction even better. I can write stories about it. I can do experiments on science. I can make new discoveries.</span>
