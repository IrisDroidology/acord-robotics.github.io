<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome Back...</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello and welcome back to Liam's Blog Season 2, whereÂ I talk about my interests on this blog. Today, it is on Galactic Collisions, which is something not many people may know about. So hopefully this will clear it up for you.</p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-11440 aligncenter" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Galactic-Collisions-1-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Â What is a Galactic Collision?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You will probably know what a collision is (I'm talking about collisionsÂ <strong>on earth</strong>). Collisions in space are just as likely to happen. For example, when two galaxies collide, it is better to think of it as mixing two jars of sand together than two cars colliding. While many stars will be shot out of the galaxy and into intergalactic space, the majority of the stars in both galaxies will be untouched. This is because of the extreme distances between the stars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Galaxies aren't the only things that can collide in space, either. Stars can collide, forming strange objects known as Blue Stragglers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-medium" src="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/photos/000/866/86678.jpg" width="16" height="16" /><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11451" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Blue-Stragglers-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="749" /></p>
Blue Stragglers are most common in globular clusters, which are huge, giant balls of stars, that can contain hundreds of thousands, even millions of stars. These stars are (mostly - some stars that weren't originally part of the cluster can be attracted by gravity) the same age and have the same composition, because they formed at the same time from the same cloud of gas (keep an eye out for my 12th post on the blog, about Stellar Formation). Since the clusters have so many stars in such a small space, collisions are common, and thus stars can collide.

As you can see, galactic collisions can occur anywhere, at any time, from any two (or more) galactic objects. From ANY type of galactic objects. Let's go on to the next topic, which is stellar collisions (in Globular Clusters, Binary systems, and more).

<h2 style="text-align: center;">STELLAR COLLISIONS</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-11466" src="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Blue-Stragglers-2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="629" />
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stellar collisions are happening all the time, even as we speak (well, as I write this anyway!). Stellar collisionsÂ are most commonly found in binary or triple star systems or (as I explained above) in globular clusters. Since the distance between (most stars) - known as interstellar space - is so large, the odds of a stellar collision that doesn't fit into the above criteria happening is incredibly small - and plus, even if the stars weren't partners before the collision, they (mostly) wouldn't just float into each other. Because of gravity, the stars would (most likely) orbit each other, thus forming a binary system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stellar orbits are quite easy (but also quite complicated) to understand, and I will be talking about them in the next post in Liam's Blog (#12).</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">GALACTIC COLLISIONS</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Galactic collisions are incredibly common (well, when you think about how big the universe is and how many galaxies are inside it, it is pretty easy to imagine that galaxies are colliding every day somewhere in the universe).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That's all for this part of Liam's Blog, check back tomorrow for some juicy news!</p>
