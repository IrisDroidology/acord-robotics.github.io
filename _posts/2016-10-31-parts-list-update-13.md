<h1 style="text-align: center;">First Up:</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hey everyone, today is update number 13 for Sp~S6. I just want to apologize for not posting for a little while. I have been really busy conducting some experiments on stuff for the Alliance of Droids, which I will explain later. I have also been designing a magazine that took up the weekend as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, Happy Halloween!</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Parts List</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In today's update, I'm going to be talking about the first parts list. This parts list is for the prototype Companion Droid. I am going to be making the prototype hopefully with some of my friends and colleagues. To make it a truly flexible design, we will be creating different heads that can suit different tastes and needs. The prototype will be an astromech droid (at least the body anyway).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will be making two prototypes, a steampunk one (Sp-D2 -&gt; Sp~S6), and a regular one, which may be called CD-A1, for Companion Droid Alliance #1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These droids will be kept for future referencing.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Parts List - Heads (Draft #1)</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Clear Plastic (Uncut) Dome - from the R2-D2 Builder's Club ($98 US)</li>
 	<li>Paint or metal covering - $unknown</li>
 	<li>Periscope, camera, small binocular eyes, etc. - $50+</li>
</ul>
Also, we will be including the links for these things in our magazine updates.
<h2>Parts List - Bodies (Draft #1)</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Wood - baltic birch would be best, but most wood types would do (we will be following the Senna design most likely)</li>
 	<li>Outer "Skin" - these will be able to be switched out depending on the situation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Parts List - Legs (Draft #1)</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>I have no idea as of yet :(</li>
</ul>
<h2>Parts List - Electronics (Draft #1)</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>SHADOW xBox 360/One Controller - R2-D2 Builders Club</li>
 	<li>MarcDuino's V1.5 - R2-D2 Builders Club - $198 - optional</li>
 	<li>Battery Boxes - $unknown</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Also...</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These parts are not definitely going to be used. I also apologize for not being too clear on much to do with this project, but I want to give room for you guys to comment on ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These posts and more EXCLUSIVE information will be included in the CD Magazine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All members are allowed to help, and will get a cool (FREE) badge for their troubles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will be experimenting with things like Arduinos, MarcDuino's, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Daleks will also be included in our themes list.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anything else I have missed will be in the next post - #14 (Special).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks for reading!</p>
