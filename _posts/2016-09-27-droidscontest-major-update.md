Breaking news: I have been working on creating the major update for the DroidsContest. In this update you are able to have multiple teams to work on different parts of your droid. This will be hugely beneficial to you guys as it will allow you to have more than the limit of people in each team.

We also have a Project Management System, which I will explain in a future post. You can co-ordinate with your team members with discussions, files, to-do lists, and more.

If anyone has any questions please don't hesitate to ask!
