<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Just a quick announcement that Liam (that's me) has a new account. My official droid builder account is located here: allianceofdroids.org.au/members/droidology but it is now only available to droid builders with the password, which you can find by becoming either a droid builder or enquiring about becoming one AND also paying 50 credits. My other account is located here: allianceofdroids.org.au/members/irisdroidology</p>
