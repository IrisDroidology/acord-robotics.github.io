<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello and welcome back to another post in the blog changes category. We are starting a new series for the main reason that I can't figure out what post we are on at the moment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this series I, and other members (hopefully) will be talking about changes to the website. These changes will be done for aesthetic and functional purposes, and the main purpose of this category is to let you know what we will be adding.</p>
We will hopefully be adding a new theme, socialize, however the theme on mobile sites will remain BuddyApp. You can see the demo for the socialize theme here:Â http://socialize.ghostpool.com/

In terms of plugins, we will be adding a wide range of plugins, including rankings for members on the BBPress forums (with member of the month, images and so much more. We will also be adding a user collection feature (where you can add things on the site to your "playlist" like on YouTube).

There will be a user blog (buddyboss.com) for all users.

There will be a back up plugin.

Also, we finally will have our own APP!!! For iOS AND ANDROID!!!! #DroidOS
