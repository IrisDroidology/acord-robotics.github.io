<h1 style="text-align: center;">Explanations</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First up, I would just like to say that I am no great robot builder. The reason why there isn't a lot of detail in the Sp~S6 blog updates is that I don't know everything. I like to post my ideas so that you can see them grow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I need someone that can help me put this into action, and I have found someone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks for your consideration.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Our Magazine</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have been trying out a few types of magazine builders, including Microsoft Word. I haven't found anything that is easy to use but has all the functions that we require. If anyone out there has any ideas I would love to hear them!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The magazine is going to be put into different categories and hopefully released every month. We have a magazine for our Companion Droids, for our members, and more. The purpose of the magazine is so that you can read the posts offline, as well as having some extra info.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also on the subject of offline reading, I also need to apologize for not releasing our #DroidCasts yet. I have been really struggling with my speaking and because of that I can't always speak clearly. I will be posting when I can speak clearly enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The magazine also has the ability to be able to include more than pictures and text. We can include tables a lot more easily. We can also do it offline. We can organize it into columns. And loads more!</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Some (SMALL) Bugs</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main bugs I have found is the registration is currently not allowed. This may be because of multisite, but it should be fixed by tomorrow. Any potential members that want to be added should provide their email address and username in the comments on any post. I can add you, and then click on the link in your email inbox to set your password. Or I will set you up with a temporary password that you can change later under the FORGOT PASSWORD link.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, the cover images are not flush. There is nothing I can do about that as far as I can tell. If any of you awesome people out there know anything, here are the details that you can work out the problem from - I use the Boss theme from BuddyBoss, and I use Canva Blog Title for my cover images. Any help would be appreciated!</p>
