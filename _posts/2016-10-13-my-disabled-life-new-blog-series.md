<p style="text-align: justify">To give people the confidence to talk about themselves, and share their experiences, the Alliance of Droids is creating a new series called My Disabled Life. We take entries from many people who have disabilities, and we publish them with their permission. We also talk about them in our Droidcasts.
</p><p style="text-align: justify">We do this for two reasons:
</p><ol><li><div style="text-align: justify">So people can find the confidence in themselves to find help and talk about themselves
</div></li><li><div style="text-align: justify">People know what it is like to go through it and be more interested in getting involved.
</div></li></ol><p style="text-align: justify">You can also ask to be anonymous, which means we won't include your name in it.
</p><p style="text-align: justify">People who don't have a disability, but have experiences with disabled people, are welcome to email us about their experiences.
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Anyone posting negative comments will automatically be banned. We just do not tolerate that, because enough of us have been treated like sh*t enough by bullies. We don't need more bullies.
</p><p style="text-align: justify">We also want people to acknowledge that many people with disabilities may be classed as bullies, but aren't really because of their problems. This is not to give them preferential treatment, they should be punished like the rest of you, but they become mean because of the sh*t they go through. I'm not saying that they're completely innocent, but you have to remember that they have different ways of thinking than most people do. 
</p><p style="text-align: justify">We at the Alliance hope that you enjoy this new series and find the courage to talk about yourself!
