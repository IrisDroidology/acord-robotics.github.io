<p style="text-align: justify;">The Science Alliance Magazine is our magazine which we talk about science. We give the magazine to people who are interested in science, including people with disabilities. This allows us to show people the beauty of science and educate our members at the same time. We are a very science-based organisation, especially as we want to do a science channel on YouTube as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To be able to edit the science magazine you need to be a member of the Science Department. We publish the magazine in a portfolio. When you become a science department specialist you get privileges to edit the portfolio directly, while members have to email their articles to the specialists/leader(s).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We can talk about any science, and will have pages for experiments, new discoveries, careers in science, and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Becoming a member of the science department is free and easy!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you sign up, you will get to choose the departments you want to work in after you reach the right rank.</p>
