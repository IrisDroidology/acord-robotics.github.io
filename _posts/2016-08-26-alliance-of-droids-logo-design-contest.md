<p style="text-align: justify;">The Alliance of Droids sadly does not have its own logo yet. We are creating a contest that anyone can enter. The logo has to fit two requirements:</p>

<ol>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Not be rude, vulgar, or discriminative</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Have a droid symbol in it</li>
</ol>
One of my favorite ones I have seen is a version of the Tie Fighter, but with the bulb shaped like droid heads!

The droid symbol requirement basically means having something that has a droid head (or entire droid) in it.

It can also not be absolutely huge.

Winner will get their logo featured on the member pins &amp; badges!
