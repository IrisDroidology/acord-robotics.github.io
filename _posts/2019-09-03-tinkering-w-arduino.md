<p>On
 the Stellarios repository, we have a branch called ‚ÄúArduino‚Äù which is 
for all our Arduino &amp; Raspberry Pi project (for example the Open 
Source Rover). We have created another repository to house the 
documentation. This is located at <a href="http://github.com/acord-robotics/arduino-stellarios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Github/Acord-Robotics/Arduino-Stellarios</a>. The documentation is also located in the Arduino branch, however we created this site for easier documentation.</p>

<p>This repository is part of <a href="http://github.com/acord-robotics/stellarios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Github/Acord-Robotics/Stellarios</a>.
 Stellarios is a suite of software developed by ACORD, an Australian 
Robotics &amp; Science Development company. Stellarios includes a number
 of games, including Asteroid Dodgers. It also includes cool robots and 
hard/software designed for use in science experiments and missions.</p>

<p>There are a number of awesome projects that we‚Äôre working on that use Arduino &amp; Raspberry Pi. One of these is a <a href="http://github.com/acord-robotics/open-source-rover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‚Äúfork‚Äù</a> of <a href="http://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASA‚Äôs Open Source Rover</a>.</p>
