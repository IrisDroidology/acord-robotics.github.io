Firstly, I should clarify: this is only for the body and frame of A0-D2.

Last week, we completed all of the straight cuts for the frame of A0-D2 (with Joel Pearman's help, and Yoann seeÂ http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/panorama/).

We still have to do our laser cutting for the circular pieces, but everything else is cut out!
