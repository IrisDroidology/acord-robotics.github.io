<blockquote><span style="font-family: aurebesh; font-size: 8pt;">@limaod has just watched Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Expect a detailed blogpost from @liamaod. Also, check out the new droidfolio: allianceofdroids.org.au/droidfolio/r3-c4-a0-d2/.
@liamaod would like to thank the members of the WA R2-Builders for a fantastic year, for inviting him to the movie, and for the droid help.
On the new droidfolio, we will include all of our designs and possible plans for Sp~S6 &amp; R3-C4. The name R3-C4 is a code.
Sp-D2 will probably not be the first Companion Droid, so it is up to debate on whether when we transform him he becomes Sp~S6 or not. The name Sp~S6 is also a code.
Thanks for all the continued support everyone! Have a great xMas, a happy New Year, and a wonderful summer (or winter) break.

Well, the year is almost over, but we still have a long way to go before our projects are finished. So, I am going to continue working over the summer. I wish you all a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year.

Last night I saw Rogue One, and it was super brilliant. I ran into a few of the R2-D2 Builders  (WA) while I was there, and we chatted a bit about all the droid news. I am starting to think about changing the size &amp; part of the shape of our droid to look something like this:
