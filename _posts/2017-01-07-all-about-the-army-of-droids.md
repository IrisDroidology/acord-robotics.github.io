Just before we get into this post, I would like to apologize for not posting anything recently, but the main thing is that there is a new post now.

I would like to provide some information about a project called the Army of Droids, that Droid Builder members can participate in.

We have been busy redesigning our Droid projects, and not all of our droids are going to be companions. Instead, these droids will be made by members of the Droid Builders and given to different members in turn. These droids will be featured in our Companion Droid App, though.

You will be able to build them out of Lego Mindstorms, Meccano, or anything else really.
