As many members may not know, we are currently managing our board of directors. We need a large amount of people to help with this and therefore we need YOU to help! New members, obviously, will not get things like COO, CTO, CFO, or General Director, but helping gets you a mention in your portfolio and may help you get big juicy roles in later years.

One of the projects the CFO will be in charge of is the Shop and our merchandise like member perks.

These roles are important and open to members:
<ul>
 	<li>CFO</li>
 	<li>COO</li>
 	<li>CTO</li>
 	<li>General Director</li>
</ul>
These roles are taken:
<ul>
 	<li>CEO (@Droidology)</li>
 	<li>Chairman (@nickoyoshi)</li>
</ul>
