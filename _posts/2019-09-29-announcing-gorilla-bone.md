<p>Gorilla Bone is an instrumental music album I've created using the Soundtrap.com music creator, a way I, and others, can create music and podcasts online for free. Gorilla Bone is an album that uses a lot of the "baby gorilla bass" style that I love to create an underlying deep beat. Gorilla Bone is currently in production and I started creating it in September 2019.</p>

<p>I've wanted to create music for a long time. I've played guitar since I was 6, and I played trumpet in the school band from 2013-14 at primary school. However, I never wrote my own songs. In 2015, when the game Geometry Dash became <em>incredibly</em> popular at my high school I began listening to more electronic, and instrumental music, and that made me want to create my own music around about last year, when I picked up Geo Dash again (briefly) while in the US.</p>

<p>With Gorilla Bone, I've tried to make the bass guitar the most vibrant and noticeable part of my album, and it creates an intoxicating sound. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
