<h1>Aardvark Theme</h1>
For the past year and a half, we have used the <a href="http://dunhakdis.com">Thrive theme</a>, however there were some limitations we were beginning to become aware of. Because of this, we have switched most of the portal over to the <a href="http://ghostpool.com">Aardvark</a> theme. Thrive is still used for:
<ul>
 	<li>Some member profiles</li>
 	<li>Some of the groups</li>
 	<li>Star Sailors</li>
</ul>
However, the rest of the portal is Aardvark. Let's check things out, starting with the home page:

That's a big complicated, isn't it? Well, let's break it down step by step.

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>As you can see, at the very top we have two menu sections - starting with Chairman's Blog and ending with Activity. This is the secondary menu.</li>
 	<li>Below that, we have our logo, and to the right of this we have our profile navigation</li>
 	<li>Underneath that we have our main menu - Starting with community</li>
 	<li>Below that we have the content, and to the right of the content we have the widgets section</li>
</ul>
<h1>The first Star Sailors planet</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">Named after the capital in the Novella (Star Sailors: Earthlings), Midgardia is the first planet in the Star Sailors ORPG. It has conditions very similar to Earth's, and was expanded upon by the aliens that inhabited it.</p>
Midgardia is a snowy planet, which means that it is prone to sub-zero temperatures. The architecture is bright blue, crystal white and splashes of green. Our next project will be designing concept images for Midgardia.

Midgardia is home to the following companies:
<ul>
 	<li>ACORD - Robotics company located in Florei District</li>
 	<li>Juganoth - Mining company located in Elsitie District</li>
</ul>
Midgardia currently has the following districts:
<ul>
 	<li>Florei - science, technology, exploration</li>
 	<li>Elsieite - labour, construction &amp; engineering</li>
</ul>

<h1>Grant updates</h1>
Currently there is no word on our new grant provider, however Yoann is working on it. We've got a new glue from Bunnings. We tested the glue on some styrene scrap and it only snapped after we applied a high force at the base. Hopefully it will work when the frame is completely glued together.
