<h1 style="text-align: center;">This Blog Series...</h1>
In this mini-series of my blog - season 2 - I am contemplating the existence of LIFE ON MARS. This is a controversial topic for many, but I hope that by reading this blog you will learn a bit more about the possibility of microbial life on Mars.

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Today's Installment</h1>
In today's installment of the Life on Mars series of my blog, we are going to be looking at the actual story on the Astrobiology Magazine that inspired me to write this blog series. You can view it here:Â http://bit.ly/2kALEpA

As you would already know if you have read the previous installments of this blog, there is PLENTY of evidence for liquid water (yes, that's H2O) on theÂ <em>surface of Mars</em> many billions of years ago, and that could still be true now. Since there is life in virtually every glass of water we drink (microbes, the occasional guineaÂ worm - don't ask what that is), it is reasonable to believe that there could be life in the puddles of water on the surface of Mars.

Previous research has also indicated at methane (CH4) being produced in the Martian atmosphere. While there are abiotic ways to produce methane (ways to produce methane without life involved), including volcanoes activity - most of the methane on the Earth is produced by living things.

Of course, it would be foolish to assume that there are fart-inducing cows on Mars, but the fact that methane in the atmosphere of Mars is being PRODUCED RIGHT NOW is a sliver of evidence that there is some sort of life - even only microbial - on Mars (at least at one point in the history of Mars).

The fact that these micro-organisms don't require drastic amounts of sunlight for photosynthesis gives evidence that life could exist below the surface of Mars. This would give them protection from the huge amount of cosmic rays that bombard Mars. But then again, if they could have been living on Mars for this long, they may have already been able to combat that problem.

This concludes the mini-series of this blog. @Droidology
