<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">My Life in Science</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">Ever since I first read a book calledÂ THE PLANETS and was instantly hooked. Since then, I have wanted to work in science.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">I wanted to work in astronomy at first, and then in Year 5 I switched to ASTROBIOLOGY. At the moment I want to be a space sciences engineer and my work with building droids will hopefully help me achieve that goal.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">Building something in space</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">This is my ultimate goal in life - designing or building something that will go into space. I want to continue building my droids because I want to create new ideas and make discoveries that will help me in the future in my career.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">I would love to send one of the droids I built into space, maybe turn it into a satellite or something. This would be a big part of the Alliance of Droids.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">What we want to come out of the story</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">This story is about achieving our goals in life and knowing that working hard gets you there. I want you to know more about me and more about life in general.</span></p>
