<h2>What are Stellar &amp; Galactic Collisions</h2>
Collisions between galaxies and stars (star v star | Galaxy v galaxy), to be frank. In this blog post, I will be talking about Blue Stragglers, SagDEG, the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, binary star systems, and black holes. I will split it into two separate blog posts as well.

There will be a Galactic Glossary at the bottom of all blog posts in this category, and you can also go to http://allianceofdroids.org.au/droidologygaming/index.php/galacticglossary/ to see the full glossary (note: wait until Saturday as it may not be up until then!!)

<h2>Blue Stragglers &amp; Stellar Collisions</h2>
I first read about Blue Stragglers in <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Extreme_Cosmos.html?id=H3BVYAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;hl=en">Brian </a>Gaenslar's<a href="https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Extreme_Cosmos.html?id=H3BVYAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;hl=en">Â "<em>Extreme Cosmos</em>".</a>

Blue Stragglers are basically stars in an open or a <strong>globular cluster</strong> (see below) that are more luminous and "bluer" than the other stars in the cluster. A globular cluster is a huge cluster of stars, up to a million or more. They are tightly bound by gravity and all (or at least most) of the stars are the same age and have the same composition (as they all/most formed from the same gas cloud). So obviously, a <strong>Blue Straggler</strong> is highly unusual - it has a different composition (maybe a higher concentration of different elements) and a different size/radius than the other stars in the cluster.

<strong>Binary star systems</strong>Â are a system of two or more (<strong>tri-binary</strong> for three...) stars that orbit each other, most stable systems would orbit at the distance from Pluto to the Sun. Mostly they are stable systems, however, sometimes one star will spiral into another (usually the one with the higher mass will draw the other one in) - this is called "<strong>Orbital Decay</strong>" - and can cause the stars to collide, forming a blue straggler, maybe even a <strong>neutron star</strong> or a <strong>black hole</strong> (if the stars have a high enough mass).

As the stars in a globular cluster are so close together, there would most likely be a huge amount of binary star systems that could have their orbits decayed, either from a mass differential (highly unlikely - remember, most stars in globular clusters are the same size and mass) or - and this is much more likely - a wandering star in the cluster comes in and disrupts the orderly orbit and the orbits decay this way.

And that's all for Part #1 of Stellar &amp; Galactic Collisions! Check the website again by Saturday and the next post will be up!
<h2>Galactic Glossary</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Binary Star SystemsÂ </strong>- a system of two or more stars (<strong>tri-binary</strong> for 3...)</li>
	<li><strong>Black Hole</strong> - a region of space having a gravitational field so intense that no matter or radiation can escape.</li>
	<li><strong>Blue Straggler</strong> -Â a main-sequence star in an open or globular cluster that is more luminous and bluer than the other stars in the same cluster</li>
	<li><strong>Globular Cluster</strong> -Â A globular cluster is a spherical collection of stars that orbits a galactic core as a satellite.</li>
	<li><strong>Neutron Star</strong> - a ball of pure neutrons, usually around 25 kilometers across. Formed from stellar collisions (<strong>very rare</strong>) or from supernovae (TypeÂ <strong>I</strong> &amp;Â <strong>II</strong>)</li>
	<li><strong>Orbital Decay</strong> - The decay of an orbit's radius</li>
