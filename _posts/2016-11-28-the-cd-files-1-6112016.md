<h1 style="text-align: center;">Our Droids</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Droids are made as companions for people with disabilities. This post is the first Build Log in the series of building Sp~S6, our prototype Companion Droid (CDP).</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">NOVEMBER 6 2016</h2>
<span>Today I was at the R2-D2 Builders (WA) meeting, with my mentor Joel. I learned a lot about building droids, with Andrew Campbell &amp; Grant Thomson. I made my first parts with Andrew, which I will talk about in a second.Â </span>

<span>This meeting was mainly for the older guys to have a chance to build their droids, but Andrew &amp; Grant sort of took me under their wing, and I helped Andrew with cutting out some styrene. Styrene is basically polystrene but without the air in it. We used a Stanley knife to cut out the styrene and made the Lowest Uprights, 8 of them.</span>

<span>These parts are basically supports for the inner frame, which will be on the inside. I have decided to build my droid out of styrene, with maybe a clear dome (R3-Style).</span>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">TODAY - NOVEMBER 28 2016</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As of today, I have not done anymore work on the droid project, but I have been in contact with Grant &amp; Andrew. We are all set to continue building!</p>
