<p style="text-align: justify;">Almost a week after losing my iPod, I recently found it. Yes, this is the SAME one, the one that I got all those years ago. I lost it around about Wednesday or Thursday last week, and on Monday I found it again. It was a great relief!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically while I was at school my mum received a call and picked it up. Thanks to whoever found it!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is just a quick post until I can prepare for a major post.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks, Liam!</p>
