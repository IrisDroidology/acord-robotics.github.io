Hey the portal is temporarily broken. Because of this, I've set up a new temp site to test out the app and the new custom theme that we're working on (we may go back to the theme that you saw, this is just a test). We have a complete back up of the portal and therefore we may have to put the backups into the new portal. Currently Reddit is serving as our base of operations until further notice. Our sponsor, Sean, who pays for the hosting, will contact Hostgator Support later (he has responded to my email but we have not agreed on a time yet for him to contact them) and hopefully it will be resolved. The new portal will have all the old posts and the backups can be browsed by anyone - as they are open-source. If we do have to start from fresh, it could be good because of WP multisite, as well as the easier set up of our RPG on the Portal. I'm appointing you as head of the UI/HI team (user/human interface), which basically means that you will review all our aesthetics of our network and tell us if you think it is good-looking as well as functional (typically I just try and put the most function in and therefore can go for themes/set-ups that don't look as good).



I'd also like to say that it's been a great 3.5 years with the portal, and that with the portal we have gained exposure, learnt more about WP & coding and are ready to step into the next chapter of ACORD
