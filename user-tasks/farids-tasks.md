# Farid's Tasks

## Reviews & Suggestions

Hey Farid, could you please review this code: http://github.com/irisdroidology/expert-goggles. Go to rpg-rover. This is a text-based game that is currently in development. You are basically a rover that is exploring Mars. All inputs for questions should be lowercast \(for example, yes, or no\). Do not type y or n for yes or no.

Tell us what you think of it here: [https://github.com/IrisDroidology/expert-goggles/issues/2](https://github.com/IrisDroidology/expert-goggles/issues/2)

We're also working on a novel called Star Sailors. Log into github and go to this link: [https://github.com/acord-robotics/starsailors/tree/master/stellarios/Star%20Sailors](https://github.com/acord-robotics/starsailors/tree/master/stellarios/Star%20Sailors) and read the book
