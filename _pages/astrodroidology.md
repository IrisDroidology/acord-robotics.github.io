I am 14 years old and was diagnosed with Aspergerâ€™s Syndrome in 2013. I created the Alliance of Droids for fun, but also to raise awareness and to be part of something. The companion robots (Droids) are like that. I wanted to help kids with disabilities, because I know that there are plenty of kids without friends and have no-one to talk to. I am sick of feeling like that and I want people to be happy for who they are.

On the 26th of October, I met Professor Jane Burns. I talked to her about my ambition, and she was deeply interested. She talked about it in one of her presentations not long ago. It was good for someone high up to know about this.

BlueFrogRobotics are one of my role-models. I really want to be partners with them as they do companion robots as well.

This was how the CD was born.

<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier;">Today I may have lost my iPod, forever. This is not aÂ happy thought, but I have to come to terms with it. For those that do not know, my iPod (@AoiPoD) is a treasured possession of mine, and I have had it since I was 10. I got it for my 10th birthday. It was a real treasure, a red beauty. But, if you are like me, you tend to lose things. This is what happened:</span>

<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier;">Every day when I go TO school via the train (and mostly bus as well). On Wednesdays I go HOME with my mentor. I first noticed that my iPod was missing from its case after I got off the train this morning. I either left it at home (not likely), left in in my mentor's car, or LEFT IT ON THE TRAIN. I had it yesterday after the train ride, so it could also be at school. The problem is someone could have stolen it - there is almost 0 chance that the train company will be able to prosecute them if they stole it on the train, and at my school there is only a small chance it will get returned.</span>

<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier;">But I will stay strong. Although I love my iPod, I do not need the physical object to bring me joy. I can remember it with photos, memories, and posts on this website. </span>

The iPod is known as Iris_Droid
It was repaired in Albany, WA for $78 after the home button had been broken

<h1 style="text-align: center;">BUILD LOG FEED</h1>
[/et_pb_text][et_pb_text admin_label="Text" background_layout="light" text_orientation="left" use_border_color="off" border_color="#ffffff" border_style="solid"]

Last Wednesday I went to Officeworks to get the blueprints for the styrene parts printed. I put them in a large mailing tube (note: I only got the skirt and basic body plans).
Last November I went to a sort of meet-up with the other members in this general area and I got some of the styrene pieces (for the lowest uprights) prepared. I have decided to mainly get the styrene in small amounts as where I am it is slightly cheaper.
So that's about it. I will add some links here for builders in Australia that want to build a styrene droid -

Styrene: http://waplastics.com

Thanks for reading this build log, and I hope that you like it (so far)!
