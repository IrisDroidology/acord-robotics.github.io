<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome!</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: aurebesh;">By Liam Arbuckle</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello everyone. My name is Liam, as you will probably know. I am the current CEO of the AoD.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This portfolio is going to include all of my artwork, news, blogs and more, and I hope you enjoy. You will be able to learn more about me by staying on this page, though.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[button size="default" url="http://allianceofdroids.org.au/droidfolio/liamarbuckle/my-collections/" open_new_tab="true" text="My Collections" icon="" type="default" bottom_margin=""]</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">My Hobbies</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have a wide range of hobbies. I really want to be a scientist when I grow up, and IÂ read a lot about space and science. I also game quite a bit. I have an xBox One, a Samsung Tablet, an iPod, a school computer, and a Samsung phone. I am quite privileged to have all these things, and I think a lot about people who aren't as fortunate as me. I help my community as well. I used to busk with my guitarÂ and my trumpet,Â mainly to raise money for wildlife rescue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On this page, I will talk about different hobbies in my life and provide links to my hobby blog on allianceofdroids.org.au.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Reading</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I have been reading for years, and I still read many of the books I read when I first started this hobby. I have a shelf - more like many shelves - full of books, and everyone in my family reads frequently. Â </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">My favorite type of books to read are adventure &amp; sci-fi. I am a big fan of the 39 Clues series, and I have been for many years.Â </span></p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Writing/Blogging</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I blog frequently, releasing posts (on average) 4 times a week. This probably comes from my love of storywriting back in year 2. I guess I like it because I share my thoughts wth the world and am the king of my storiestories.</span></p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Science</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since I was 3 or 4, I have beenÂ dreaming of being a scientist or an astronaut. This is so real to me, unlike previous generations, because we are going to space rightÂ NOW. There have been hundreds of astronauts and the dream is more real than ever to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to have a legacy or a purpose, and what better way to go to do that than to go into science? To achieve this, I buy all the books and equipment I can find that could give me a chance of gettingÂ my dream job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You will be able to see more about this on my science page!</p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Gaming</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">My first gaming device that was mine was my iPod 5, which I have had since 28/10/2012, and I got it for my birthday, 18 days before.</span></p>
